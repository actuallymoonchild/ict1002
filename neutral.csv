Right now Japan doesn't even allow visa holders in, only nationals and residents and they have to quarantine.

140,"&gt; # Founder Bak Kut Teh closes Bugis &amp; Hotel Boss outlets due to bad business amid pandemic

&gt; Founder Bak Kut Teh has shut down two of its outlets in Singapore.

&gt; The outlet located opposite Bugis Junction was the first to close in October 2020.

&gt; In December 2020, it was announced that that outlet in Hotel Boss was also shut down.

&gt; Founder Bak Kut Teh is now left with only two outlets in Singapore -- Balestier Road and Downtown East.

&gt; Affected by Covid-19 pandemic

&gt; Second-generation owner Nigel Chua said that the business at the two closed outlets was badly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.

&gt; According to Lianhe Zaobao, closing the two outlets was a joint decision by Chua and his dad.

&gt; The Bugis outlet had depended mainly on tourists and the office crowd.

&gt; However, due to the pandemic, the crowd size was reduced.

&gt; The outlet at Hotel Boss also heavily relied on tourists and thus suffered the same fate.

&gt; Sent out a public appeal

&gt; On July 15, 2020, Chua took to social media to send out a public appeal.

&gt; The appeal, however, was met with both support and criticism.

&gt; While some have expressed their intent to patronise the stores, others criticised the family for their ""lavish lifestyle.""

&gt; After the appeal, business improved slightly but quickly plunged again.

&gt; Might close the Downtown East outlet

&gt; Chua also said that he will decide if the Downtown East outlet in Pasir Ris will close, reported The Straits Times.

&gt; His contract with Downtown East will end in mid March 2021.

&gt; However, Chua plans to keep the Balestier Road outlet running, hoping that things will pick up after Chinese New Year this year.

I think Singapore is more than ever now feeling the impact of lack of people in areas where it matters most - Healthcare, Education etc.

And guess what people in these professions are now in demand everywhere (not just SG).

These days indian and Filipina nurses are being offered express pathways to US green cards, French citizenship etc just to bring them onboard.

The fact is that it’s these professions today (due to Covid) but maybe another profession tomorrow. If we build an image that we are unwelcome to foreigners (except labourers and foreign helpers) who want to eke out a decent living here, people from developing countries will choose other countries.

I am indeed. I'm not really bothered about this, I just look at these things and wonder whether there's any point at all if the system is so easy to game.

&gt; The system is already very leaky if negative ART is all that's needed for an exposed case to go out. The sensitivity of ART is not so good.

Why don’t we shift the cost of their choices on to them instead of onto everyone else? I propose the following three step plan:

1) remove all barriers to entry at malls;

2) bar unvaxxed from entering malls but impose fines if they’re found to have visited a mall in defiance of the law; and 

3) hike their health insurance premiums by a significant multiple (to be deducted directly from their CPF) compared to a vaxxed individual with the same risk profile. This reflects the increased risk to having serious complications from Covid. A grace period of four months is allowed to go and get your vaccine and allow it to take effect before the increase will take effect. 

As with many things, I suspect hitting people hard in the pocket will be far more effective than almost any other penalty.

593,"So far, this is the most sensible reply I have seen in this thread.

Yes, I completely agree. As my all my previous post had try to explain... The issue is not about getting infected (or not). We need to prepare for the eventuality that everyone, at some point (including HCW), will get infected with COVID.

What we need to be concern here is the reproduction rate and the capability of our healthcare infrastructure to deal with the demands. So far, disappointingly, it seems like we are playing catch up with the increased demand.

Despite so much call for ""opening up"" and ""living with covid"", we had not prep our healthcare service well enough to deal with the demand. The government is working now with the ambition to expand healthcare facilities to deal with 5000 daily cases, but I highly doubt that this would be achievable. At about 1.5k to 2k daily cases, the workload for the HCWs is already very punishing. I cannot imagine how it is going to look like if we push towards 5k and beyond.

The reality, and as reflected by the downvotes here, is that we are really not ready to ""live with COVID"" yet. Regardless of what the government, experts and redditors (in r/sg) said, deep down inside we all know that COVID is different and is really not ""just a flu"". 

To live with COVID, is not to underestimate the danger of the virus and downplay the seriousness of the infection. It is understanding the different role that the government and individuals have to play.

Government has a country to run. They will eventually have to restart economic activity and ease more restrictions for the reopening. 

As an individual, we should not see the reopening as a sign that the danger of COVID is over. We should continue to educate ourselves about the virus and take personal responsibility for our own health and well-being. That is to continue maintain good personal hygiene, wear a mask, limit party/gathering sizes (without government mandate), avoid crowded places and continue to maintain social distancing where possible.

As a community, we should keep a close watch and be concern if the rate of infection and hospital admission grew too fast. Not just on the ICU numbers, but also those who are seriously ill as well. The “serious illness” numbers can very quickly turn into ICU numbers.",30/9/2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/pxyb2x/ward_closures_in_6_acute_public_hospitals_in/hesot0w/

610,"&gt; # Ward closures in 6 acute public hospitals in recent weeks as 130 case detected among staff and patients: MOH

&gt; SINGAPORE - Seven wards in six acute public hospitals here have been closed in the two weeks leading up to the latest barring of visitors to hospital wards here that began last Friday (Sept 24), said the Ministry of Health (MOH).

&gt; This came as 130 hospital staff and patients who were admitted to the affected hospitals for non-Covid-19 ailments tested positive for the virus in the same period, the ministry said on Wednesday (Sept 29).

&gt; The affected hospital staff included both clinical and support ancillary staff, MOH said in response to queries from The Straits Times about the latest hospital visitation restrictions.

&gt; ""Currently, about 15 per cent of the hospital beds in the acute public sector hospitals are used for Covid-19 patients,"" said the ministry.

&gt; MOH said that hospitals have cross-deployed staff from other areas within the hospital to mitigate the impact on staffing levels due to the infected staff.

&gt; ""This is done in strict adherence to infection control measures including the donning of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment,"" it said.

&gt; ""All patient-facing staff are also enrolled in frequent surveillance testing to detect any infection early and prevent transmission in the hospitals.""

&gt; Fewer than one per cent of all staff in public hospitals were placed on leave of absence, stay-home notice, quarantine order or health risk warning for the period from Sept 13 to Sept 19, said MOH.

&gt; Visits to hospital wards have been disallowed for four weeks from Sept 24 to Oct 23 due to more Covid-19 cases being detected among hospital staff, patients and visitors, the ministry said last week.

&gt; The detection of cases among hospital staff had necessitated ward closures and quarantines, which has put a strain on hospital bed capacity and staffing at a time when more beds are needed to care for hospitalised Covid-19 patients, MOH said last week in explaining the need for the stoppage to ward visits.

&gt; Only specific patient groups are exempted on a case-by-case basis - such as those who are very ill or mothers about to give birth - and all approved visitors have to produce a valid negative ART or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result obtained within the last 24 hours of each visit.

&gt; ""Our hospitals continue to provide services to the public and to care for patients with Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 medical conditions,"" said an MOH spokesman.

623,"&gt; # How Covid-19 and other trends hit Singapore's population - in 8 charts

&gt; SINGAPORE - Singapore's population saw a record fall over the past year as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, official figures released on Tuesday (Sept 28) showed. The Straits Times looks at some of the key numbers and trends.

&gt; 1. Second year in a row population fell

&gt; The Republic's total population as at June fell for the second straight year, down to 5.45 million, from 5.69 million in 2020. This 4.1 per cent decrease is the largest year-on-year decline - and only the third instance of negative growth - since 1950.

&gt; 2. Fewer citizens, PRs

&gt; The citizen population decreased by 0.7 per cent, to 3.5 million. The permanent resident population also decreased by 6.2 per cent, to 490,000, as more citizens and PRs remained overseas continuously for 12 months or more due to travel restrictions.

&gt; 3. Further decrease in non-resident population

&gt; The non-resident population decreased by 10.7 per cent to 1.47 million, largely stemming from a decrease in foreign employment due to travel restrictions and uncertain economic conditions. The decrease was seen across all pass types, with the largest drop in work permit holders in the construction, marine shipyard, and process (CMP) sectors.

&gt; 4. Ageing population

&gt; With more people living longer and fewer children being born, the proportion of citizens aged 65 and above is rising at a faster pace compared to the last decade, from 10.4 per cent in 2011 to 17.6 per cent in 2021. This is expected to increase to about 23.8 per cent in 2030. Meanwhile, nearly 62 per cent of citizens are between the ages of 20 and 64, down from 65 per cent in 2011.

&gt; 5. Fewer citizen marriages

&gt; As some Singaporeans postponed their marriages due to restrictions on large gatherings, last year saw 19,430 citizen marriages, 12.3 per cent fewer than the 22,165 such marriages in 2019. The largest drop in quarterly numbers was in Q2 2020, when in-person solemnisations had to be postponed during the circuit breaker, from April 7 to June 1, 2020.

&gt; 6. Fewer transnational marriages

&gt; Partly due to travel restrictions, last year saw a significant decrease in the proportion of citizen marriages involving transnational couples. The proportion of inter-ethnic marriages also dipped slightly but remained consistent at about 20 per cent.

&gt; 7. Fewer citizen births

&gt; Last year saw 31,816 citizen births, 3.1 per cent fewer than the 32,844 such births in 2019. The sharpest dip was in the last three months of 2020, with 8,000 births compared to 8,700 for the same period in 2019. As many of these babies would have been conceived around the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in Singapore, in February 2020, the lower number suggests that some couples may have postponed their parenthood plans due to the pandemic. A similar decrease in births was also observed in other advanced societies last year, such as the United States, Japan and Italy.

&gt; 8. Fewer new citizens, PRs

&gt; There were fewer new citizens and PRs last year, arising from limited slots to complete the final steps for PR and citizenship registration, which have to be done in person. Altogether, 21,085 individuals were granted citizenship and 27,470 individuals were granted PR. About 6 per cent of the new citizens, or 1,344 of them, were children born overseas to Singaporean parents - a figure lower than previous years due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

&gt; 19 imported cases

&gt; There are also 19 imported cases, who have already been placed on Stay-Home Notice (SHN) or isolated upon arrival in Singapore.

777,"I totally feel for you. Thank you so much for tanking on the frontline. I was extremely disgusted when the government message switched to ""everyone will get infected eventually"", ""COVID is just like a flu"", ""take infection like a booster shot"". 

COVID has presented itself to be very different from other Coronavirus pandemic we had before. One key feature is the asymptomatic transmission of the virus. Vaccinated individuals can still have high viral load when infected, which made them infectious. While we may not see zero covid anytime soon, what we can hope is to try not to get infected as much as possible until we have a vaccine that can break the transmission chain effectively (and yes, this is not something new).

On the economic front, the world cannot stand still forever either. It has to open up eventually and resume economic activity. I hope that the government will maintain the stand on masking and limiting diner density in eatery.

I hope you won't get overly paranoid when the government reopen. But we can do things to keep ourselves safe. This include wearing mask diligently, sensitize hands frequently and avoid crowded places. This will place much inconvenience to you.

1031,"&gt; # Commentary: Why home isolation is key to Singapore’s transition to endemic living

&gt; SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health’s announcement on Friday (Sep 10) that Singapore will push ahead with home isolation of milder COVID-19 cases marks an important step in the country’s journey towards the endemic era.

&gt; Fully vaccinated young people with no underlying illnesses will recover at home rather than at the hospital by default from Wednesday onwards, after a pilot programme saw encouraging results.

&gt; The arrangement will be progressively extended to those aged 50 or below with no significant illnesses – a group that accounts for half of all infected cases now, according to Health Minister Ong Ye Kung.

&gt; A NEW PHASE OF THE PANDEMIC FOR SINGAPORE

&gt; Indeed, Singapore has moved into a new phase of the pandemic.

&gt; High vaccination rates have enabled this shift by substantially reducing the severity and risk of death of “breakthrough infections” involving the fully vaccinated, even with the emergence of the Delta variant.

&gt; MOH data for cases identified over the past month shows that for every 1,000 breakthrough infections, only seven were sick enough to require oxygen supplementation with none dead or needing intensive care.

&gt; Seen from the lens of severe disease, the current situation is not as bad as it appears from record-high community cases. There are seven in intensive care as of Sunday (Sep 12).

1039,"&gt; # Home recovery to be default from Sept 15 for bulk of vaccinated people who get Covid-19: MOH

&gt; SINGAPORE - Most people who are vaccinated and contract Covid-19 will be put on home recovery from Wednesday (Sept 15), the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Tuesday.

&gt; This care management model will apply to those who are fully vaccinated, aged 12 to 50 years old, have mild or no symptoms, no severe comorbidities or illnesses, it added.

&gt; They should also not have household members above 80 or who are in one of the vulnerable groups such as pregnant women, those with weakened immune response or those with multiple comorbidities.

&gt; When a person tests positive, home recovery can start immediately if he or she meets the criteria.

&gt; The individual will need to set aside a room with an attached bathroom, said MOH.

&gt; There is no need to go to a hospital or community care facility.

&gt; Covid-19 patients on home recovery will undergo an initial remote assessment by a telemedicine provider on the first day of their home recovery to ensure that they are clinically well.

&gt; These individuals will also be issued with an isolation order and may be tagged with an electronic monitoring device to ensure they remain in their designated room at home.

&gt; MOH earlier said that from Sept 11, the quarantine period has been cut from 14 days to 10 days from the last exposure to a Covid-19 case provided that the quarantined person tests negative for Covid-19 at the end of quarantine.

&gt; On Tuesday, MOH said quarantined persons who had received quarantine orders before Sept 11 and have completed 10 or more days in quarantine and have a negative polymerase chain reaction test result will progressively have their quarantine orders rescinded earlier.

&gt; They will then have to continue to self-administer antigen rapid tests (ART) from day 11 to day 14 from their date of last exposure.

1096,"&gt; # Every S'pore household to receive 10 ART Covid-19 self-test kits: MOH

&gt; SINGAPORE - The Health Ministry will be conducting another round of distribution of antigen rapid test (ART) kits, as Singapore heads towards a new normal where frequent testing for Covid-19 becomes common.

&gt; This distribution exercise will last from Oct 22 to December, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said in a virtual Covid-19 multi ministry press conference on Saturday (Oct 9).

&gt; This is so as to provide more support for regular self-testing at home, he added.

&gt; The distribution will be done via SingPost and each household will receive a package containing 10 ART self-test kits.

&gt; This is a pivot in Singapore's Covid-19 strategy, Mr Ong said.

&gt; All the complicated rules frustrate people and are a constant reminder to people that Covid-19 is a scary disease when, in fact, the vast majority of infected people have mild or no symptoms, he said.

&gt; Earlier at noon, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, addressing the nation, urged Singaporeans to be the first line of defence, and help protect the hospitals and healthcare workers standing as the last line of defence.

&gt; The population can do this by continuing to abide by safe management measures, cutting back on social activities, getting their vaccinations and booster shots, and self-testing regularly, said PM Lee.

&gt; This ART kit distribution is not the first.

&gt; Earlier in July, more than 225,000 Covid-19 self-test kits were distributed to residents and visitors who visited markets and food centres linked to the Jurong Fishery Port cluster.

&gt; In September, ART kits were made available for collection round the clock from vending machines placed in various housing estates, including Choa Chu Kang, Toa Payoh, Woodlands and Pasir Ris.

1150,"&gt; # Covid-19 cluster at an NKF dialysis centre; 10 patients in ICU

&gt; SINGAPORE - A new Covid-19 cluster was announced at an NKF dialysis centre at Boon Keng on Monday night (Aug 9), taking the number of active clusters here to 131.

&gt; The NKF Dialysis Centre (Sakyadhita) at 19 Upper Boon Keng Road added one new case on Monday, taking the total number of cases linked to the dialysis centre to three cases, said the Ministry of Health in its nightly virus update.

&gt; There are also currently 10 patients in critical condition in the intensive care unit (ICU), and a total of 35 cases of serious illness requiring oxygen supplementation. The last time the number of ICU cases reached the double digits was in May 2020.

&gt; Seven of these 45 cases are fully vaccinated, of which five require oxygen supplementation while two required ICU care, as they have underlying medical conditions.

&gt; Altogether, there are 34 seniors above 60 years who have fallen very ill, said MOH. Of this group, 28 are completely unvaccinated or partially vaccinated.

&gt; Singapore recorded 69 new locally transmitted coronavirus cases on Monday, including 20 unlinked cases. There were also three imported cases, for a total of 72 new cases.

&gt; The Westlite Juniper Dormitory also saw an additional eight new cases on Monday, bringing the size of the cluster to 39 cases.

&gt; The Jurong Fishery port cluster also grew by two cases, bringing the cluster to 1,148. The ministry also gave an update on the nation's vaccination drive - more than 3.8 million people or 70 per cent of the population have been fully vaccinated as at Sunday, and over 4.3 million or 79 per cent have received at least one dose.

&gt; A total of 131,497 doses of the Sinovac vaccine have also been administered as at Sunday, covering 81,709 individuals.

&gt; There is continued evidence that vaccination helps to prevent serious disease when one gets infected, said MOH.

&gt; Over the past 28 days, 99 local cases required oxygen support, were admitted to the ICU or died. Of these patients, 60 are unvaccinated, while 28 are partially vaccinated and 11 are fully vaccinated.

&gt; The number of new cases in the community fell from 835 cases in the week before to 526 cases in the past week, while the number of unlinked cases dropped from 261 to 149 cases over the same period.

&gt; SINGAPORE: Requiring COVID-19 vaccination status checks at hawker centres and coffee shops will ""add to the burden of already struggling operators and stallholders"", authorities said on Thursday (Aug 26).

&gt; The Ministry of Health (MOH) and the National Environment Agency (NEA) were responding to a Facebook post made by food blogger KF Seetoh.

&gt; In his post, he questioned the ""two-people mandate"" for hawker centres and coffee shops, and said he ""still gets info about closures almost daily"".

&gt; Under current COVID-19 measures, people are only allowed to dine in groups of two at coffee shops and hawker centres, regardless of their vaccination status.

&gt; Only fully vaccinated individuals are allowed to dine in at food and beverage establishments, in groups of up to five.

&gt; ""It's still two at the kopitiam and hawkers but ironically five at indoor air-con food courts (as if circulated indoor air is much better),"" said Mr Seetoh.

i think people feel stuck in the middle. on one hand, you have countries such as the US/UK where (right now) they have very minimal restrictions with a lower vaccination rate than ours; and you have other countries (NZ/Aus) who, before their recent lockdowns, were able to live their life as normal (no masks, barely any rules, etc.). Singaporeans cannot relate to either or.

1437,"I’m tired too. I know this isn’t the case for a lot of people, but sharing the place where you work with the place where you live was never a good idea long-term. And no, I don’t mean that WFH is bad. I believe it should be an option for those who need it.

What I mean is that not everyone has the luxury to WFH, and for those who do, a lot don’t have home office set ups that would offer a separation of work and personal life. We usually work in desks in the bedroom or shared common areas, which can be tiring because even when resting, the anxiety of seeing the computer and being reminded of work is a bit taxing for me. I want to work in a setting where I can leave work in the office. I work more hours in WFH setting while actually being less productive. I’d rather spend overtime in the office and do nothing at home but rest rather than be conveniently in my home but still thinking about work nonetheless

I am privileged to work in a company with flexible work arrangements as an option, even before Covid-19. But WFH being the default despite not encountering any issues in transitioning to a WFH set up was still mentally taxing for me, which I did not expect. It is hard, but even more difficult when living alone. I got sick in June and also got injured and that pretty much took a toll on me. All I thought of was what about my work and not even what about my health. I also had a hard time since I don’t know anyone in Singapore that much and I have never been back home in almost 2 years. I haven’t seen my family in as long. 

I can only speak for myself, but apart from being tired and anxious from extended WFH periods, I feel like no one really is talking about how we are sort of “forced” to work under a pandemic and that 2020 was never really discussed and is being forced under the rug as we now are just months away from 2022. I know this is all part of the new normal, but I feel like we haven’t even recovered from the events of 2020, and then we encountered an even more challenging 2021. And 2022 is fast approaching already. I feel as if that if I ever refer to 2020 as something that affects me, it would be received negatively and I will be branded as someone who needs to just move on. But it was never discussed and no “debriefing” was done.

I feel guilty just saying these things as I am in a very privileged position still especially compared to if I was back in my home country during Covid. But the reality is that it’s also very difficult even in a place that has largely managed the pandemic quite well and being employed still despite everything that happened.

I hope others feel way better and for those who are also struggling in a similar way, I hope you will all find ways to make it better.",23/8/2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/p9pgnv/what_small_inconveniences_covid19related_or/ha00g38/

1551,"&gt; # Unvaccinated school staff, non-govt employees in contact with students to undergo regular Covid-19 tests from Oct 1

&gt; SINGAPORE - Teachers and school staff who have not been vaccinated against Covid-19 will undergo twice-weekly antigen rapid tests (ARTs) from Oct 1, as part of the vaccinate or regular test regime for public sector employees.

&gt; This will also apply to non-government employees who have regular contact with students aged 12 and below, including those working in tuition and enrichment centres, Education Minister Chan Chun Sing said in a Facebook post on Friday (Aug 13).

&gt; At the same time, cleaners in tuition and enrichment centres that cater to students aged 12 and below will also be required to undergo regular testing under the Fast and Easy Testing (FET) regime from Sept 3.

&gt; Staff in schools working in higher-risk settings, such as cleaners and physical education teachers, are required to undergo testing every two weeks as part of the FET regime.

&gt; These are among measures taken by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to adopt a more sustainable approach towards school cases as Singapore moves towards living with an endemic Covid-19.

&gt; In his post, Mr Chan noted that about 216 students out of Singapore's 600,000 student population were infected by the Covid-19 virus from May to July. About half of these - 103 - were primary school students.

&gt; More than half of the cases were isolated through leave of absence (LOA) or quarantine order (QO) before they tested positive, which meant that no contact tracing was required in schools as they did not pose any risk to their schoolmates, the minister said.

&gt; Over those three months, more than 20,000 students across 50 schools were placed on home-based learning at different times and for varying time periods.

&gt; None of these students were Covid-19 positive, as all close contacts of confirmed cases had already been placed on LOA or QO, Mr Chan said.

&gt; Since early August, the ministry has moved towards a more targeted approach when dealing with Covid-19 infections, he noted.

&gt; ""This means that where possible, we will place close contacts and students from the same classes or CCA groups under LOA or QO, instead of putting the entire level on HBL. The disruptions are further minimised this way.""

&gt; He said that the MOE wants to expand its options for less-invasive testing methods, to enable children and families to experience even less disruptions when Covid-19 infections are uncovered.

&gt; ""Testing would allow us to be much more targeted in terms of who should stay away from school and for how long,"" he said.

&gt; For example, with more regular and faster testing using self-administered ARTs, students and staff who are tested negative can return to school earlier.

&gt; ""As new scientific evidence emerges and we accumulate more experience, we will further calibrate the suite of measures and apply them based on the circumstances, to keep our schools and children safe,"" said Mr Chan.

&gt; ""Where necessary, we will tighten measures, balancing the considerations for risk management with the impact of the disruptions.""

1596,"&gt; # Ho Ching: 'Slow down' social interactions, especially where masks are down

&gt; Ho Ching, Chief Executive Officer of Temasek Holdings, urged the public in a Facebook post on Sep. 7 to slow down their social gatherings, especially in settings where masks are not worn.

&gt; Limit social gatherings

&gt; Ho's post came after the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced a restriction of social gathering and interactions at workplaces on Sep. 6.

&gt; The new restriction kicks in today, Sep. 8.

&gt; Ho expanded on her point in a later Facebook post on Sep. 7, where she specified that social gatherings should be limited to a maximum of two per week.

&gt; She added: ""Just tahan (Bahasa for endure) for another two to four weeks.""

&gt; This, according to Ho, is part of a ""tango"" of loosening and tightening measures to seek the right balance between the measures in place, and the number of Covid-19 cases within the community.

&gt; Ho: Three to four weeks to see impact

&gt; While there are hidden cases infected with Covid-19 within the community, Ho said the number of Covid-19 community cases will not go up immediately.

&gt; She equated this to a ""laggy system"", where the effects will only be seen after some time.

&gt; In light of this, Ho said that the number of Covid-19 community cases will only increase one to two weeks later.

&gt; This is because of silent carriers, who unknowingly transfer the virus to others, within the community.

&gt; This, coupled with the Delta variant, speeds up the rate of transmissions within the community.

&gt; As such, Ho said that it would take between 13 to 14 days before the trend of community cases reflect the measures in response to curb the spread of Covid-19.

&gt; This is the same restriction that MOH has encouraged all individuals to reduce their non-essential social activities at a media doorstop on Sep. 6.

&gt; Ho went on and said that the measure of Covid-19's local impact includes the number of people with severe illnesses that require oxygen support in Intensive Care Units (ICU).

&gt; As Covid-19 becomes endemic, the focus will be shifting away from the number of daily Covid-19 cases and towards the number of cases in ICU instead.

The book tells the story of a group of people that works behind the scenes to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. It starts in 2005, when a group of people were tasked by President Bush to write a pandemic response plan. It follows them, and others, throughout the years and their effort to fight COVID-19 in early 2020.

2. Sure, that could happen but the whole premise of vaccination is to reduce the impact and effects of contracting covid as well as the break the chain of infection given that you are less likely to transmit the virus when vaccinated.

To give context to above comment, from the footnotes in the above source, it seems 'Fully Vaccinated' = 14 days after completing 'Full Regimen' whereas 'Completing Full Regimen' would only be those that had received both doses (or 1 for vaccinated recovered individuals).

The 48.9% 'Full Vaccination' figure is actually for those that had completed the Full Regimen (received the 2nd dose). Hence while 50% full vaccination is a key milestone, we are still 2 weeks away from the actual target we are looking at.

Once the person taking the 2nd dose that puts us across the 50th-% 'Full Vaccination' mark, we just need to countdown 2-weeks from there.",21/7/2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/oodjht/weekly_vaccination_update_total_6957352_first_729/h5ycse3/

And no matter which way it happened, once it reached the fishery port, it went to dozens of wet markets, which are essential businesses that would remain open even with CB. Wouldn't be surprised if some supermarkets are next.

Er, the fishery port cluster started because someone there went to KTV.

2263,"&gt; # HDB resale volume slows in September; buyer resistance seen as prices hit new peak

&gt; SINGAPORE - Resale Housing Board flat transactions slowed in September, with signs of resistance setting in as flat prices hit a record high.

&gt; There was a total of 2,518 HDB resale transactions last month, an 8.4 per cent drop from August, according to flash data from real estate portal SRX released on Thursday (Oct 7).

&gt; However, prices rose 0.9 per cent in September compared with the previous month, and surpassed the previous peak recorded in April 2013 by 0.8 per cent, according to SRX data.

&gt; This makes for 15 straight months that HDB resale prices have climbed. Hikes were seen in both mature and non-mature estates, and across all flat types last month.

&gt; Some 23 HDB flats were sold for at least $1 million in September, lower than the 26 such transactions in August. They make up though just 0.9 per cent of the total resale transactions last month.

&gt; A total of 174 HDB flats have transacted for $1 million and up so far in 2021, a 278.3 per cent jump from the same period in 2020.

&gt; Ms Christine Sun, senior vice-president of research and analytics at OrangeTee &amp; Tie, said that sales in September slowed as rising prices kept some would-be buyers on the sidelines.

&gt; She noted that other factors such as the Hungry Ghost Month and viewing restrictions imposed in line with Singapore's stabilisation phase from Sept 27 may have contributed to the slower sales last month.

&gt; Huttons Asia chief executive Mark Yip also acknowledged the price resistance from buyers.

&gt; ""The average monthly price gains over the last six months have been hovering around 1 per cent, lower than the average monthly price gains in the early part of 2021,"" he said.

&gt; HDB flash estimates released earlier this month showed that resale prices rose 2.7 per cent in the third quarter over the previous three-month period. This was lower than the 3 per cent increases recorded in the first and second quarters of this year.

&gt; Mr Yip said that construction delays are limiting the supply of flats put up for sale by HDB upgraders.

&gt; ""Coupled with the higher demand for four-room and larger flats, there is supply and demand imbalance in the market giving sellers the edge in pricing,"" he added.

&gt; Even with sale momentum potentially slowing, the total number of resale flats sold this year will reach to between 28,000 and 29,000 flats, Mr Yip forecast. This would be above the 24,748 resale applications registered last year, when Covid-19 curbs were tighter, but also the highest since 2010, when over 32,000 resale flats were sold.

&gt; Ms Sun said that prices of HDB flats may continue to rise if construction delays remain prolonged and young couples turn to the resale market for alternate housing, but also highlighted the price resistance demonstrated given that flat prices have risen to new highs in many locations.

&gt; ""Therefore, it may take slightly more time to close deals, especially for pricier flats. Some buyers may also consider other housing types as price gaps seem to be narrowing between HDB resale flats and some older private condominiums or resale executive condos,"" she said.

2353,"&gt;according to this Moderna should be about the same level of protection as the original strain from China

No this is not what the article suggests. The article says that in terms of vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies, a ""modest 3.2 to 2.1 fold reductions were seen for lineages of the variant first identified in India including Delta and Kappa"" compared to the antibody response against the original variant.

Since there's a weaker antibody response against the Delta variant, this means that Moderna's efficacy against Delta variant will probably be lower compared to the original variant. In any case, this is just a study of only 8 patients so I wouldn't be too quick to draw any conclusions from it. In general, there is a lack of good data for Moderna's efficacy against the Delta variant.

In contrast, there is plenty of real life data for the Pfizer vaccine against the Delta variant. For example, this [study from the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/vaccines-highly-effective-against-b-1-617-2-variant-after-2-doses) shows that 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine has 88% efficacy against symptomatic Delta variant Covid.",7/7/2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ofe32c/full_covid19_vaccination_provides_69_protection/h4caaqq/

But I just want to highlight that the main market with COVID spread is Henderson market (115 Bukit Merah View) which was closed for 2 weeks, and not Redhill Market (85 Redhill Lane). Redhill market was only visited by COVID positive people, all the stall holders were promptly tested and none of them were positive for the virus. Even the blocks surrounding the market which had to undergo mandatory testing because “positive virus particle found in the sewage”, there were no positive cases found (except the Blk 90 one which is Further away to the market than these blocks). I think the news articles that were talking about Bukit merah view market (and not the common name as Henderson Market) but used Redhill market’s photo scared everyone into avoiding this place. If you didn’t know, they are different places. 

Anyway I just want to put out a plea to everyone, Redhill market and hawker is safe, the positive cases are a distance away.

2738,"I definitely understand where you're coming from. I certainly don't want my 11 year old nephew, 84 year old grandpa, or my first child next year falling sick. However, from a policymaker's point of view, one must consider the impact on the population as a whole, across all demographics, classes, and social circles. In addition to the hundreds of infected people, the government must also answer to the thousands of small local businesses who have had little to no income, hundreds of thousands of workers who have suffered pay cuts or job losses, and millions of taxpayers who directly fund these multi billion dollar support schemes. We must not forget the households whose lives have been turned upside down by the loss of a family member to covid, but also those who sacrificed their jobs and livelihoods in order to protect the most lives in 2020.

Ultimately, we decide how much risk is acceptable in our daily lives. Just as we accept the daily risk by driving a car, eating fried food, and do exercise, COVID is a risk which will exist in our world moving forward. What we know  is that the threat posed to young children is similar to that of influenza, and while we must certainly take precautions against that, this type of risk has been one we have accepted for decades. It would be more harmful to society as a whole if the education and development of an entire generation of children were hindered.",24/6/2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/o6r2ll/more_covid19_clusters_likely_as_spore_reopens_but/h2v6zir/

&gt; SINGAPORE: Thirty-one new COVID-19 cases were reported in Singapore as of noon on Wednesday (Jan 6), said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in its preliminary daily update.

&gt; Two are locally transmitted cases in the community, said the ministry, adding that no new infections were found in foreign workers' dormitories.

&gt; The remaining 29 cases are imported and had been placed on stay-home notice or isolated upon their arrival in Singapore. They include three Singaporeans or permanent residents and 12 foreign domestic workers.

&gt; Details of the new cases will be released on Wednesday night, MOH said.

&gt; Two foreigners who travelled to Singapore tested positive for COVID-19 since the start of the reciprocal green lane arrangement, said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong on Tuesday.

&gt; 

&gt; Mr Gan was responding to a parliamentary question by Member of Parliament for Sengkang He Ting Ru.

&gt; Ms He asked how many Singaporeans and foreigners who travelled under the green lane scheme had tested positive for COVID-19 during the 48-hour period of self-isolation upon arrival.

&gt; Up until Dec 26 last year, close to 2,500 people came to Singapore via seven reciprocal green lanes, Mr Gan said.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; He added that the two foreigners, both from Japan, were detected during the mandatory on-arrival COVID-19 test for travellers under the green lane scheme.

&gt; As of Wednesday, Singapore has reported a total of 58,780 COVID-19 cases and 29 fatalities from the disease.

The most logical thing to do is get to the point where you think we have achieve herd immunity and start opening up.

3361,"Singapore plans to roll out vaccines to students, followed by everyone else eligible, in what will be a “great acceleration” of vaccinations in the country, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said in an interview on CNN.

“Our next step is that we’re going to offer vaccination to our school students, the teenagers,” Balakrishnan said, “following which it’ll be open season for everyone in Singapore.” The city-state earlier flagged that almost all of its eligible population could be given at least the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine by the end of August.

Vaccinations in Singapore are currently open to those aged 40 and above, as well as for priority workforces, such as first responders, hospital staff and airport workers. About 37% of Singapore’s population has had its first jab of the vaccine, a rate far ahead of most developed Asian economies, on par with the European Union’s average, but trailing the U.S., U.K. and Middle Eastern financial hubs like Israel, the U.A.E. and Qatar.

Singapore is one of several countries, mostly in Asia, that have largely kept Covid caseloads and deaths to a minimum but have struggled to reopen. The city-state has tightened its borders and, following a recent uptick in cases, suspended in-person dining, transitioned most schools to at-home learning, and limited groups to a maximum of just two.

Widespread vaccination, then, has become Singapore’s key to reopening.

Balakrishnan said the country has not seen significant vaccine hesitancy, though has been limited by supply. However, infrastructure that can support additional injections capacity is in place, and the country aims to double its vaccination pace.

“Watch this space,” he said. “You’re going to see a great acceleration.”",28/5/2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/nmqcs5/singapore_plans_to_vaccinate_students_then/gzq643g/

3397,"&gt; # COVID-19: Singapore tightens border measures for travellers from Australia's Victoria state

&gt; SINGAPORE: Singapore will tighten border control measures for those with a travel history to Australia's Victoria state, after a spike in COVID-19 cases there, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Thursday (May 27).

&gt; From 11.59pm on Saturday, short-term travellers holding an Air Travel Pass with travel history to Victoria within the last 21 days before departing for Singapore will not be allowed to enter the country.

&gt; Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term pass holders with travel history to Victoria within the last 21 days before departure will be subject to an on-arrival COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, a seven-day stay-home notice at their place of residence, and a COVID-19 PCR test before the end of the stay-home notice period.

&gt; All other travellers departing from Australia who have been in Australia (excluding Victoria state) in the last 21 days prior to travel will continue to be subject to a COVID-19 test upon arrival at the airport, in lieu of their stay-home notice.

&gt; ""Given the increased cases observed in Victoria state, Australia, we will be tightening border control measures for travellers with travel history to (the state),"" MOH said.

&gt; The Health Ministry said it will continue to adjust Singapore's border measures to manage the risk of importation and transmission to the community as the global COVID-19 situation evolves.

The only exit is when enough people are vaccinated that no matter how large an outbreak, there are few or no serious complications (like death).  There's a global supply shortage, even if there are local excesses (e.g. Hong Kong).  But with every passing day, the situation is better - more people are vaccinated and so less impact happens.

What I'm looking forward to is when the Covid positive count is no longer the main metric; the number of people hospitalised/killed should be the key metric to be worried about.  You can have 1000+ daily cases but if there are only 5 hospitalised a day, it is not quite as urgent a problem.",27/5/2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/nlxxo5/how_about_an_exit_plan_for_singapore/gzlzl6j/

For example, Chile has a 40% vaccination rate with SinoVac but covid cases are spiking.

3602,"&gt;However, it emerges that the Singapore Ministry of Health had called the B.1.617.2 as an “Indian variant”. In a press release on May 4, it had spoken of identifying 60 new cases in Singapore of which there were “seven local cases with B.1.617.2 (Indian) variant”. It is not known whether the Indian mission in Singapore had pushed back against the Singapore Ministry of Health terming the strain as an Indian variant.  
Almost the entire western media has termed B.1.617.2 as an “Indian strain” though the political leadership such as the UK Health Minister Matt Hancock or US Secretary of State Joe Biden has never linked this variant to India.  
There is heightened sensitivity among governments about linking any strain of the Covid virus to their nations after Beijing aggressively pushed back against attempts to brand Covid as the “Chinese virus”.

We simply cant depend on stringent SOP in hospitals and airports to 100% prevent leakage of COVID cases into the community as seen in the current debacle. We just have to accept that we have to live with the virus and ensure a swift and good vaccination program to prevent severe illness, death and high takeups of hospitals ICU in Singapore instead of zero COVID cases. People who are mostly vaccinated with mild or no symtomps can continue with their life as per usual. This will allow us to return to normalcy instead of suffering having to change the rules whenever there is an outbreak similar to this.

Im sure we are all suffering from COVID fatigue, and im one of them. I just hope they dont try to go forward to that plan of zero COVID cases after this.

3945,"Let's not use priviledge to render someone's argument invalid as that doesn't speak to something concrete nor actually directly relevant in influencing potential case counts.  (Speaking to your comment as well as those of others)

It's not about pointing fingers, it's about like what other people have said, this is not new, it's been happening every weekend. This was alright given that community cases have been low, and people have not yet been advised to stay home. But what about now? The government has clearly made it explicit to us that we should minimize non-essential gatherings and avoid going out if we don't need to, so this image doesn't speak to anything about priviledge, but rather the inability of those who formed the crowds to change their behaviour in light of new recommendations given by the government. Honestly, I would be just as disappointed if these images were those of Singaporeans, as no matter what background you are, the dynamics of how covid spreads remains the same.

You can also compare these crowds to those in the MRT, but I would argue it isn't really the same. The latter is formed out of necessity, the former is formed by people who ""want to feel at ease"". (I presume those who gathered there arent there to work)


It is easy to say that whoever has gathered in the crowd has done so due to a lack of priviledge, or how whoever disagrees does so due to an overabundance of priviledge. However, doing this just strips them of all agency to do the socially more responsible thing of staying home OR at the very least avoiding a place which they have known to be historically crowded. So with this I would say IF a cluster were to emerge from these gatherings, locals who headed to PLQ for a meal that wasn't necessarily would also bear some of the responsibility for the cluster. (If we were to blame FDWs, which clearly aren't the ONLY ones gathered.)

The bottom line is IF one claims to care about the covid situation in Singapore then really going to place you know to be crowded uncecessarily is an action you'd naturally condemn. You can be sympathetic to the reasons as to why the crowds have formed, but that doesn't mean to 'let them be' or condemn anything that criticizes it as 'priviledged'.",14/5/2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/nbf77c/paya_lebar_today_good_job_singapore/gy1fy78/

If  shit does hit the fan and there is a sudden surge of covid hospitalizations, you WILL see all elective procedures stop, clinics get cancelled, and we will all get redeployed, on top of what you have described regarding sending some people home instead of hospitalizing them. We're braced for it; the surgeries either already prioritised by urgency or can be prioritised and cancelled within 24h. Furthermore, ""send 10x people home"" is not the same as ""expand our capacity by 10x""; it means triage conditions have changed and things we had the leeway to keep inpatient must now be discharged. As to whether that affects quality of care, well, depends on how bad triage situation gets. 

Additionally. Some hospitals are running at the usual 95+ % bed occupancy rate. As of right now, there are patients who've been kicking around in A&amp;E for 24h. Imagine what the covid load will add to that, if a surge happens. 

So what i'm saying is, we have planned for the surge. There were contingency plans drawn up from last year and the ops teams have been updating them. But don't think that comes free, and I don't mean financially. And don't put it into people's heads that we have a whole bunch of empty fucking beds we can just pull out of our asses.",8/5/2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/oxq2bx/interesting_behavior_in_covid_hospitalization_and/h7r9vej/

This follows a surge of COVID-19 infections in India in recent days. 

The new requirement will take effect from Thursday at 11.59pm.

With immediate effect, Singapore will also reduce entry approvals for non-Singapore citizens or permanent residents due to the worsening situation in India and the emergence of new virus variants, said MOH.”

4436,"&gt; # Vendors not buying Naiise founder Dennis Tay bankruptcy story, say money woes began since 2016

&gt; Dennis Tay, founder of Singapore's home-grown retailer Naiise, said he is filing for bankruptcy after his business folded, but not everyone is buying his story that the Covid-19 pandemic did him in.

&gt; According to people who have had business dealings with Tay and Naiise over the years, their woes of not getting paid have been ongoing for years, some as far back as 2016.

&gt; Tay's Facebook post about filing for bankruptcy has also since disappeared after it was put up on April 15 and stayed up online briefly for at least a day.

&gt; Brand owners and vendors hit back

&gt; The Straits Times spoke to some of the brand owners and vendors who were owed their fair share of money.

&gt; They shared about the difficulties they faced dealing with Naiise and Tay from a few years back that had nothing to do with the current pandemic that supposedly did Naiise in.

&gt; Ong Yin Hao, co-founder of Nom Nom Plush, was owed S$15,000, but got paid more than half a year late.

&gt; He told ST he dislikes how Tay is using the pandemic to frame the failure of Naiise.

&gt; Ong revealed he stopped receiving payments from Naiise after Christmas in 2019.

&gt; Laraine Tan, co-founder of The Forest Factory, faced late payments a few months after July 2015, shortly after starting her business and is owed S$7,500.

&gt; Clearly angered by the news of Naiise folding and Tay saying he is filing for bankruptcy, Tan wrote her side of the story on Facebook on April 15.

&gt; Her post also sought to explain to laymen the dynamics of working with a platform like Naiise and how it was not possible for brand owners and vendors to not receive payment regularly or when there are sales.

&gt; She also told ST she only found out about Naiise closing down from reading online articles.

&gt; Ling Hooi Yin, artist and creator of TinyPinc Miniatures, is owed a four-figure sum.

&gt; She took to Instagram to share the “pity e-mails” she got from Tay and recorded phone calls with him promising to make payment.

&gt; Lilian Lee, founder of card game Say What With Friends, is owed RM493.80 (S$160) for products stocked at the Malaysia store.

&gt; Brand owner explain how it got to this extent

&gt; Some, such as Visakan Veerasamy, who is owed S$20,000 wrote on Facebook that it is also the brand owners and vendors who let the whole thing ""get that far"", despite not getting paid for years.

&gt; He also used an expletive to describe Tay.

&gt; In the comments in the post, Visakan also revealed his mindset and how he wanted things to work out eventually for good.

&gt; He wrote:

&gt; we even *paid* them to hold our stock while they owed us money on past sales. 😩💀 when the music stops suddenly everything looks incredibly stupid

&gt; Blog about Tay put up questioning his claims

&gt; A Wordpress blog, Not Naiise, The Truth About Naiise, has since been put up.

&gt; It compiled social media posts showing the purported lifestyles Tay and his wife led prior to Naiise's closure, including living in a condominium in town and various holiday trips the couple embarked on over the last few years.

&gt; It also highlighted the problems employees and vendors faced by collating Glassdoor reviews, which served as a counter narrative to the words of encouragement Tay put up in his post about filing for personal bankruptcy, but which has since been removed or hidden.

&gt; SINGAPORE: Singapore Airlines’ flights to Hong Kong were suspended after the airline breached one of the city’s “trigger points” for COVID-19 testing requirements, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) said on Friday (Apr 2).

&gt; 

&gt; SIA passenger flights departing from Singapore will not be allowed to land in Hong Kong from Apr 3 to Apr 16, the government of Hong Kong said earlier on Friday.

&gt; 

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Hong Kong authorities said in a press release that a passenger on SQ882, flying from Singapore to Hong Kong on Mar 31, was confirmed to have COVID-19 after being tested upon arrival in the city.

&gt; 

&gt; Three passengers had also “failed to comply” with requirements specified under Hong Kong’s disease control regulations.

&gt; 

&gt; Under Hong Kong’s COVID-19 testing requirements for arriving air passengers, the city has “set trigger points whereby airlines could face suspension”, said a CAAS spokesperson.

&gt; 

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; “SIA breached one of the trigger points. Other airlines have also similarly breached the trigger points before as the Hong Kong authorities enforce them strictly.”

&gt; 

&gt; The individual who tested positive for COVID-19 is a transit passenger. The passenger had tested negative prior to departure but later tested positive upon arrival, said the authority.

&gt; 

&gt; The three “non-compliant passengers” were also transit passengers who had undergone COVID-19 pre-departure tests at clinics in their places of origin that did not meet Hong Kong’s requirements, said CAAS. All three passengers tested negative for COVID-19.

&gt; 

&gt; SIA confirmed on Friday evening that it has been asked to suspend its daily passenger service from Singapore to Hong Kong from Apr 3 to Apr 16. Passenger service from Hong Kong to Singapore is not affected.

&gt; 

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; “SIA has taken immediate steps to strengthen checks at the point of embarkation to ensure that our customers are in compliance with Hong Kong’s regulatory requirements. We will also assist the health authorities in all contact tracing efforts related to this case,” it added.

5335,"Just saw Mothership further stoking up hatred against China by mistranslating what China people said as claiming hanbok and kimchi belongs to China. Then full of comments laughing at China and say claim covid-19 as China virus. When actually, China people are saying that the pickling of vegetables and ancient forms of korean ethnic costumes are inspired by China.

I have respectfully and politely tried replying to those comments and attaching screenshot of the factual wiki description. 

I myself was born in China and migrated to Singapore at 5. I consider myself 100% Singaporean. My surname is distinctly non Singaporean. I encountered a lot of people hating me when they found out that I was born in China (despite I can't choose where I'm born). Maybe Singaporeans' ancestors are luckier bc they came to Singapore first in the 1800s, and SG turned out so prosperous unlike China. But i love SG and I don't treat it as a stepping stone. I just want to clarify the facts for the Mothership issue because I feel like half the time netizens are angry bc of bad translation. They need someone bilingual like me who can say in a nice tone what's the reason for China people to say such stuff.

I remember when I first come to Singapore, I can't speak English. Someone stole my pencil, but complain to my teacher who happen to be Malay that I'm lying. So the teacher beat me. I don't want other people to be misunderstood again like me.",18/2/2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/lmbser/its_hard_for_some_to_commiserate_with_singaporean/gnv65ea/

5414,"&gt; # Daily number of COVID-19 cases in Singapore may rise to more than 5,000 next week: Gan Kim Yong

&gt; STREAMLINE HEALTHCARE PROTOCOLS

&gt; Singapore needs to streamline its healthcare protocols, said Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung.

&gt; “The testing and isolation protocols from QO (quarantine order), HRW (health risk warning), HRA (health risk alert), RRT (rostered routine testing) - quite a bit of alphabet soup - they were designed during a time when we were trying to snuff out every cluster that we discovered and detected,” he said.

&gt; ""We are in a totally different position now, as we try to ride safely through this transmission wave to emerge more resilient on the other side, and able to live with COVID-19.""

&gt; The protocols are ""many and complex to the man in the street"", Mr Ong said, and that to them it is ""confusing and even frustrating"".

&gt; ""Few people truly understand or remember it. This issue needs to be addressed because if people don’t understand, they can’t do their part to exercise personal responsibility, much less help others,"" he added.

&gt; ""It also contributes to an overall apprehension that COVID-19 is a very serious disease when actually for vaccinated people it has become a mild disease.”

&gt; The task force is reviewing the protocols ""holistically"" and will present them soon, said Mr Ong, adding that they want to make the protocols simple and easy to remember.

&gt; VACCINATIONS

&gt; The percentage of patients who require intensive care ""remains low"", at about 0.2 per cent, said the Health Ministry.

&gt; But with the higher number of cases, this can translate to a ""larger absolute number"", said MOH. Currently, 34 ICU beds are occupied but the Health Ministry said it expects this number to rise.

&gt; There remains “strong evidence” that vaccination protects people against severe disease, added MOH.

&gt; The proportion of fully vaccinated cases who needed intensive care or died is about 14 times less than that for the unvaccinated, the ministry noted.

5453,"&gt;People make the mistake of comparing it to last year. I think it's inevitable that there is even less space this year. Last year was mostly online. But this year, international students will finally be coming here and NTU has to prepare for their SHN in the halls. On top of that, the local universities were pushed to accept even more local students by the govt because they can't go overseas. So the sudden rise in number of students and the need to provide SHN this time around would have overflowed demand.

In the previous 2 sems, whole halls were closed in order to provide quarantine locations. The school was as crowded as it was before covid times, and halls were bustling with foot traffic. This was due to NTU's mismanagement of physical classes. Many lessons were still conducted physically with max capacity per class at 50. Nothing has changed this coming semester when compared to the previous 2 semesters. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I'm not sure how many of the complaints are really legitimate though. Some people complain about ""coming from Bishan"". Hall is really a privilege, not an entitlement. Compared to NUS or even worse, SMU, NTU has the most number of halls available. 

Many students who didn't get halls were Y2 students. And it's not a myth that NTU GUARANTEES hall placement for Y1 and Y2 students, so yes, for many of these students it's an entitlement. 

Staying in the far north/east/northeast really takes a toll on you when you have to travel to and fro school everyday. It's normal to have &gt;3 hour daily commute times and that takes a toll on your physical health. It's a legitimate concern for students to apply to hall because they don't want to travel 2 hours to school to attend class, because you'd be exhausted by the travel even before you start the day. 

I don't even know why you are trying to compare SMU and NUS, because they are located centrally , right infront of MRT stations. Students living anywhere in Singapore would have greater access to these Universities compared to NTU, which is at the far end of Singapore and located so far away from the MRT station. Even students living in Jurong itself can report up to 1 hour of commuting time to school.",7/2/2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/obqsq4/review_of_hall_vacancies_sends_ntu_students/h3rj1xf/

5771,"&gt; # 30% of S'poreans said they gained weight during Covid-19 pandemic

&gt; Some 30 per cent of Singaporeans said they gained weight during the Covid-19 pandemic.

&gt; The average increase was around 5kg.

&gt; About the survey

&gt; This finding was made by marketing research company Ipsos in an online study to find out how health choices have changed during the pandemic.

&gt; Other findings were culled from the survey with 500 respondents, aged between 21 and 74, who were interviewed between Oct. 23 and Nov. 6.

&gt; What survey found

&gt; Although the survey found that some people in Singapore gained weight during the past 12 months of the pandemic, weight loss is a persistent issue.

&gt; The survey revealed that:

&gt; - 40 per cent of respondents in Singapore said they have been exercising more

&gt; - 55 per cent of respondents in Singapore said they are trying to lose weight

&gt; - 25 per cent of respondents in Singapore said they are trying to lose weight gained during the pandemic

&gt; - 70 per cent of respondents in Singapore want to lose weight not gained during the pandemic

&gt; - 70 per cent of respondents in Singapore said they want to lose weight to reduce risk of suffering severe symptoms if they get Covid-19

&gt; - 24 per cent of respondents in Singapore said the perceived risk of Covid-19 is motivating them to try to lose weight to reduce the risk of severe Covid-19 symptoms

&gt; Exercise the preferred method

&gt; The most popular way to slim down was to get more exercise, the survey found.

&gt; The next most popular method was to reduce one's food intake and eating healthily without dieting.

&gt; However, just 10 per cent said that they will opt to abstain from meat and alcohol.

&gt; The easier habit to kick appears to be consuming sweetened food.

&gt; Some 65 per cent could cut down or forgo sugar.

&gt; Half of the respondents said companies and governments could introduce cheaper healthy food to help people lose weight.

&gt; Around 20 per cent hoped to see more green public spaces available for exercise, while 15 per cent wished for healthier ingredients in processed foods.

5970,"&gt; # Australia to reopen borders from November, easing 18-month-old travel restrictions

&gt; SYDNEY: Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Friday (Oct 1) announced an 18-month ban on Australians travelling abroad will be lifted from next month, easing one of the toughest COVID-19 restrictions imposed globally.

&gt; Reopening the international border for citizens and permanent residents will be linked to the establishment of home quarantine in Australia's eight states and territories, Morrison said, meaning that some parts of the country will reopen sooner than others.

&gt; The first phase of the plan will focus on vaccinated citizens and permanent residents being allowed to leave Australia, with further changes expected to permit foreign travellers to enter the country.

&gt; On Mar 20 last year Australia introduced some of the world's toughest border restrictions in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

&gt; For the last 560 days, countless international flights have been grounded, and overseas travel has slowed to a trickle.

&gt; Families have been split across continents, an estimated 30,000 nationals were stranded overseas and foreign residents were stuck in the country unable to see friends or relatives.

&gt; More than 100,000 requests to enter or leave the country were denied in the first five months of this year alone, according to Department of Home Affairs data.

&gt; ""The time has come to give Australians their life back. We're getting ready for that, and Australia will be ready for takeoff, very soon,"" Morrison said.

&gt; He also announced that vaccinated residents would be able to home quarantine for seven days on their return, dodging the current mandatory and costly 14-day hotel quarantine.

&gt; The exact timing of the border reopenings will depend on when Australian states reach their 80 per cent vaccination targets, and crucially on local political approval.

&gt; The most populous state of New South Wales currently has 64 per cent of those aged over 16 fully vaccinated and has indicated it will hit 70 and 80 per cent targets this month.

&gt; But most Australian states - most notably West Australia and Queensland - still have no widespread community transmission, are pursuing a strategy of ""COVID-zero"" and remain shut to other parts of the country.

&gt; Friday's announcements could mean that within a month it is easier for those in Sydney or Melbourne to travel to London or New York than to go to Perth or Brisbane.

&gt; Australian flag carrier Qantas welcomed the decision, announcing it would restart flights to London and Los Angeles on Nov 14.

&gt; ""FORTRESS OZ""

&gt; Expats and foreign residents gave the news a cautious welcome on social media forums. But experts say many Australians will remain cautious about booking travel for fear of snap lockdowns or other disruptions.

&gt; And the impact of the unprecedented period in the country's history could be felt for years to come.

&gt; ""Australia has been a fortress nation with the drawbridge pulled up to the rest of the world,"" Tim Soutphommasane, an academic and former Australian race discrimination commissioner told AFP.

&gt; ""What we're seeing now with this announcement of borders being reopened is akin to Australia re-entering the world, and it's long overdue,"" he said.

Our 7-day average death is 0. The US is at 648 for the same stat. Talking about stat ""we should care about"" then at least cite reliable averages.

One would argue that the difference is not in the harm of COVID. Both Tokyo and NYC are equally harmful places to be in right now. Just that Tokyo has more restriction while the US has less. 

Heck, Singapore and Melbourne are still much less harmful places to be in 2021.

&gt; SINGAPORE: The Secondary 1 posting results will be released next Tuesday (Dec 22) at 9am, the Ministry of Education (MOE) announced.

&gt; The posting results can be accessed through the following channels:

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; - Short Messaging System (SMS) text messaging, if it was provided during the application process

&gt; - S1 Internet System; or

&gt; - At the student's primary school

&gt; In previous years, students would report to their posted secondary schools on the next working day after receiving the information. In light of the COVID-19 situation, students do not need to physically report to their posted secondary schools this year, said MOE.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Instead, students should refer to their posted schools’ websites from Dec 22 for more information such as instructions on the online purchase of books and uniforms, booklist, and the reporting details.

&gt; Parents of the incoming Secondary 1 cohort who are on Parents Gateway will also receive instructions from the posted schools from the afternoon of Dec 22.

&gt; ""If students are unable to report to their posted secondary school on the first day of school on Jan 4, 2021 due to valid reasons, they may contact their posted secondary school directly to confirm that they are taking up the place, and the school will be able to reserve the place for them,"" MOE added.

&gt; Parents and students may refer to MOE's website for more information.

In the same vein as his proposal to cut down on unnecessary emissions and pollution from flights to nowhere, he should file questions on cruises instead of flights.  
Some reasons to choose from - 

(1) they are cruise rides to nowhere

(2) marine pollution

(3) surely we remember how cruise ships are COVID death traps, like the Diamond Princess

(4) ppl ride cruises to gamble in international waters too. A lot of Chinese uncles and aunties do it. Should we allow them to do it during a pandemic + recession? Maybe not.

6722,"&gt; # Forum: Singapore-bashing over treatment of migrant workers is unwarranted

&gt; Nominated MP Anthea Ong asked if the Government would consider issuing an apology to the migrant workers under lockdown in dormitories (Govt's response to outbreak will be reviewed after crisis, May 5). And Mr Andy Chew Teck Huat suggested that Singaporeans need to apologise for the state these workers are now in (All of us guilty of poor treatment of foreign workers, May 7).

&gt; Living conditions at foreign workers' dormitories are strictly within the purview of the employers and workers. This is a commercial arrangement.

&gt; Thus, if there is any violation related to the living conditions, then the dormitory operator and the employer should bear the consequences and be taken to task.

&gt; Why does the nation need to apologise to the migrant workers? The Government does not operate the dormitories or employ the workers.

&gt; Also, if the migrant workers have any grievances, there are many avenues they can turn to.

&gt; For instance, the Ministry of Manpower's foreign manpower management division oversees workplace standards for foreign workers and enforces foreign workforce policies.

&gt; And there are several migrant worker organisations that can address their needs.

&gt; The recent Singapore-bashing over the coronavirus outbreak among migrant workers has gone to the extreme.

&gt; While Singapore may be indebted to these migrant workers, let us not forget that they are here to make enough money so that they can return to their home countries to lead a more comfortable life.

&gt; In Singapore, these workers are not underpaid or short-changed.

&gt; It is a win-win situation for both parties.

&gt; In fact, the care shown by the Government can be seen during this Covid-19 period. In some other countries, the costs of accommodation, food and virus testing for such workers are borne by their employers or embassies.

&gt; But in Singapore, the Government has taken it upon itself to bear the costs.

&gt; Let us be fair to Singaporeans and stop this bashing.

&gt; Lee Kek Chin

7205,"&gt; # 87 new Covid-19 cases in S'pore on Sep. 11, no cases in community

&gt; The Ministry of Health (MOH) has preliminarily confirmed 87 new cases of Covid-19 infection in Singapore as of Friday, Sep. 11, 12pm.

&gt; This brings the total number of cases in Singapore to 57,316.

&gt; Based on MOH's investigations so far, there are no cases in the community.

&gt; There are 14 imported cases, who had all been placed on Stay-Home Notice upon arrival in Singapore.

&gt; MOH said that among the 73 cases residing in dormitories today, 33 are from Avery Lodge Dormitory, the majority of whom had been placed on quarantine earlier and were tested during quarantine to determine their status.

&gt; The remaining cases were detected through surveillance testing, such as the ministry's bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing.

&gt; This allows MOH to pick up cases in the dormitory early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission.

&gt; Number of cases in September so far

&gt; Here are the daily number of cases in September:

&gt; Sep. 1: 40

&gt; Sep. 2: 49

&gt; Sep. 3: 48

&gt; Sep. 4: 40

&gt; Sep. 5: 34

&gt; Sep. 6: 40

&gt; Sep. 7: 22

&gt; Sep. 8: 47

&gt; Sep. 9: 75

&gt; Sep. 10: 63

7312,"&gt; # People should wear a mask when going to the market or they will be turned away: NEA

&gt; SINGAPORE - People should wear a mask when shopping at any market, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has said.

&gt; From Sunday (April 12), those who do not will be turned away at the 40 markets managed by the NEA or NEA-appointed operators.

&gt; NEA said that the generally crowded and closed-in environment in markets, as well as the continued crowding observed at the start of the long weekend on Friday, have led it to make the move.

&gt; Reusable masks have been made available to all residents since April 5, and people can still collect them at community clubs and residents' committee centres across the island until Sunday.

&gt; The latest update is in addition to the crowd management measures, such as controlled entry and exit points, that the NEA has already put in place. NTUC Fairprice had earlier urged all its shoppers to wear masks during their grocery runs, and has stipulated that all its staff must wear masks when working.

&gt; On Friday, more than 2,900 stern warnings and 40 $300 fines were issued to people who flouted safe distancing measures across the island, as the authorities noted an increase in the number of people out and about on Good Friday, a public holiday.

&gt; In more than 20 cases, the police were also called in as people were not cooperative despite repeated instructions to leave clustered areas. The Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) repeated its warning that failure to comply with circuit breaker measures will be met with firm action.

&gt; People should also not go on family outings during this period, or they could risk being issued a stern written warning for the first offence, a $300 fine for the second, and prosecution in court in the third.

&gt; The National Parks Board (NParks) on Friday had to temporarily close access bridges at Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve and Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, as well as the Henderson Waves and MacRitchie TreeTop Walk after crowds in these recreational spots surged.

&gt; It said it issued more than 90 stern warnings and fines to those who who were gathered in groups or who entered areas that had been closed in parks managed by it and Town Councils.

&gt; The Singapore Food Agency also issued a $1,000 fine to an operator who was illegally selling face masks at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 on Friday, while the police are investigating a beauty salon in Upper Cross Street that was found to have provided massage services without a licnce during the circuit breaker period.

&gt; The number of Covid-19 cases in Singapore crossed 2,000 as of Friday noon, reaching 2,108 cases. A seventh person has died.

7714,"&gt; # 550 complaints of illegal deployment of maids yearly from 2017 to 2019: MOM

&gt; SINGAPORE - An average of 550 cases a year of maids being made to work illegally by their employers or household members were handled by the Ministry of Manpower from 2017 to 2019.

&gt; This formed just 0.2 per cent of the over 236,000 employers of foreign domestic workers (FDWs) here.

&gt; Three quarters of the cases came from alerts by third parties, and a quarter were complaints made by the maids themselves, said MOM on Tuesday (Sept 8) in response to press queries.

&gt; The issue of illegal deployment of FDWs came under the spotlight after Ms Parti Liyani, a former domestic worker employed by Changi Airport Group chairman Liew Mun Leong and his family, was acquitted of stealing from them.

&gt; Ms Parti had been told by Mr Liew's wife, Madam Ng Lai Peng, to go her son, Mr Karl Liew's home to help there. She said she also cleaned his office once a week for a year.

&gt; MOM said it had consulted the Attorney-General's Chambers and, in May 2018, issued a caution against Madam Ng and an advisory notice to Mr Karl Liew.

&gt; An advisory notice is issued when the illegal deployment is not conclusively substantiated, while a caution is akin to a stern warning by the police, and is issued when MOM establishes that the illegal deployment is infrequent or took place over a short period of time.

&gt; ""The caution sends a strong message to employers that they must comply with the law or face stronger enforcement action,"" said MOM.

&gt; There were no prior complaints against the parties in the case, added the ministry.

&gt; From 2017 to 2019, MOM took action against a yearly average of 155 employers for illegally deploying their FDWs.

&gt; Each year, about 60 employers were issued with advisory notices while 80 employers were issued with cautions. About 16 employers were given financial penalties, ranging from $3,300 to $24,000.

&gt; MOM said a ""good number"" of FDWs who alleged illegal deployment had left their employment when they reported the matter to the Ministry. Some asked for help to return home while others asked to be allowed to transfer to a new employer.

&gt; MOM said it treats seriously and looks into every allegation. In most of the cases, the FDWs had been deployed with their charges - either children or elderly persons - to close family members to continue to provide care to their charges.

&gt; The Ministry added that this is permitted so long as the FDWs accept the arrangements, are not required to perform the household chores of two families, and have their well-being taken care of.

&gt; MOM said it takes a stern view of cases when maids are deployed to participate in non-domestic work or to work in commercial premises, regularly and over a long period of time.

&gt; ""It would be especially egregious if the FDWs are overworked and not provided with adequate rest. Their employers can be issued with financial penalties of up to $10,000 per count. They will also be debarred from hiring FDWs,"" said the Ministry.

&gt; It added that multiple efforts are taken to ensure maids are cared for by their employers.

&gt; First time workers attend a mandatory programme which informs them of their rights, including proper deployment by their employers.

&gt; MOM said it also regularly sends educational materials to maids, and that they are advised of the different channels of assistance available.

&gt; ""They can also report illegal deployment or another other employment difficulties to the Ministry. They do not have to wait till they have left employment,"" said the Ministry.

&gt; FDWs who are unsure if their deployment is lawful should also contact MOM's FDW Helpline on 1800-339-5505 to seek clarification and assistance.

* max 5 people in a group in an F&amp;B establishment, which must shut by 10:30pm and ensure you're separated from other tables by at least 1m (3 feet or so)

* last orders in F&amp;B by 10pm, drinks taken off people at 10:25pm sharp. No mingling between 2 different groups of 5

* temperature checks whenever you check in anywhere

* no more than 5 guests allowed into your home

* restrictions on the number of people in an inside space (I think it's ~50 max inside a gym, but I don't know here - it might depend on the square footage)

* cannot get a PCR test unless you've been prescribed one (i.e. have symptoms and a doc has agreed you need one). This means you can't leave Singapore to go overseas as most places need a negative test taken before you fly

* predominantly still work from home - if you're able to you should continue to do so, although this seems to be weakening a bit

* stand 1m apart from anyone else when shopping, queuing etc

That might be it. Salons and spas have been opened for ages (with masks). It's not the hardest place to live (much better than when on full lockdown), but it does feel a bit oppressive on occasions when you realise you can't do a lot of the things you used to do.

Right now I'm just glad we can do the basics here.",24/9/2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/iymgj7/covid19_government_may_present_plans_for_phase_3/g6drswf/

&gt; SINGAPORE: New COVID-19 cases found at the migrant worker dormitories are a result of routine testing, and these cases are surfacing as “part of the plan”, said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo on Wednesday (Aug 26).

&gt; “We have planned for every single one in the construction, marine and process sector, as well as the people who come into close contact with them, to be regularly tested. So, the findings today are a result of those testing,” Mrs Teo said.

&gt; “That is what we are doing, it is part of the plan and it is surfacing as part of the plan.”

&gt; Speaking to the media after visiting a US medical technology firm on Wednesday, Mrs Teo said: “If we had not implemented rostered routine testing, it doesn't mean that the cases don't exist - it just means that we don't know about it.”

&gt; However with the testing, clusters can be identified early, infected workers can be given appropriate care and their close contacts can be quarantined to contain the spread, she said.

&gt; COVID-19 cases among migrant workers in dormitories have formed the bulk of more than 56,000 infections in Singapore. Authorities took about four months to test all workers, more than 300,00 of them.

&gt; The testing was completed on Aug 7, and the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) declared all dormitories “cleared of COVID-19” on Aug 19 but urged continued vigilance.

&gt; This was partly because even before Aug 19, about 100 new cases of COVID-19 were detected in dormitories that were previously given the all clear from the virus.

&gt; A few new clusters have been found at other “cleared” dormitories since, including a cluster of more than 60 at Sungei Tengah Lodge, Singapore's largest purpose-built dormitory. Around 4,800 workers were issued stay-home notices at the dorm along Old Choa Chu Kang Road.

&gt; Infectious diseases experts told CNA that there are several reasons why dormitories “cleared” of COVID-19 would still see new cases and clusters.

&gt; “It’s important to be clear what ‘clearing’ means,” said Associate Professor Alex Cook, vice-dean of research at the National University of Singapore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.

&gt; “At the point at which the clearing of any particular dorm was done, there were no remaining infections that we had identified. That does not mean that there were no infections.”

&gt; For example, a person could have been infected a day or two before the clearance exercise, and still test negative for the virus.

&gt; “Even though the vast majority of ‘cleared’ residents were not infected, some infected residents will have been allowed out, where they may have come into contact with workers living in other dorms or in the community,” he said.

&gt; 

&gt; “We try to pick these up through report-sick operations and repeat testing of residents but it would be far too expensive to do daily testing, so some will be missed, and outbreaks can grow,” said Assoc Prof Cook.

&gt; Infectious diseases expert Dr Piotr Chlebicki told CNA that because workers in the dormitories are young, healthy men, many of them don't display any symptoms when infected.

&gt; ""These people don't have large amounts of the virus ... and it's easy to kind of miss it from time to time. If one sneaks through, then everything starts all over again,"" said Dr Chlebicki, who runs the Infectious Diseases Medical Clinic at Mount Alvernia Hospital.

&gt; 

&gt; MOM said that it is trying to prevent a second wave of infection in the dormitories through prevention, detection, containment and isolation.

&gt; Migrant workers staying in the dormitories are “cohorted” by the type of industry that they work in and safe distancing measures have been implemented there. They need to undergo the rostered routine testing every 14 days.

&gt; 

&gt; While the Health Ministry and MOM have been proactive in preventing new clusters, there are limits to this, said Associate Professor Josip Car, director of the Centre of Population Health Sciences at the Nanyang Technological University’s Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine.

&gt; But he added that the circumstances are now very different from when cases in the dormitories first spiked in April.

&gt; “Now that worker dormitories are more spread out, with clearer demarcation between the presently healthy and the infected, we should be better placed to trace and isolate the transmission spread to mitigate any potential unlinked transmission cases,” he said.

&gt; “We learn every day how to better detect virus, how it spreads, how to manage the infection. We now have a wide range of measures in place, including in dormitories, which make it more difficult for the virus to spread.""

&gt; Assoc Prof Cook said that unless there is population immunity among the workers at the dormitories, there will always be the risk of more infections, but there will not be an “explosive spread” as before.

&gt; “It is clear from the recrudescence of these outbreaks that herd immunity has not been reached in at least some dorms, 15 to 20 per cent of the residents have been identified to be infected through swabs to date, which is far too low to confer herd immunity on them,” he said.

&gt; “Fortunately though even if the dorms, or an affected dorm, haven’t reached herd immunity, the fact that some residents have been infected already will prevent explosive spread like we saw in April.”

&gt; Assoc Prof Car warned that people should not “drop their guard” and advised that social distancing remains “paramount”.

&gt; “Phase 2 has been happening for a while and it feels like some normality is returning in terms of normal social behaviour, but if anything, we should not reduce our own individual vigilance. This isn't a migrant-or-locals issue. COVID-19 doesn't look at one's passport.”

&gt; Singapore reported 60 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, taking the cumulative total to 56,495. As of Tuesday, there were 78 patients still in hospital and 1,514 cases are isolated and cared for in community facilities.

8843,"&gt; # 106 new Covid-19 cases in Singapore, 39 linked to known clusters at foreign worker dormitories

&gt; SINGAPORE - Singapore reported 106 cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday (April 7) said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in its daily update.

&gt; Of these, 103 are local cases and three are imported. They bring the total number of cases here to 1,481.

&gt; Among the local cases, links to existing clusters have been established for 52 cases, of which 39 are linked to clusters at foreign worker dormitories.

&gt; There are 10 cases that have been linked to other cases. Contact tracing is being done for the remaining 41 cases.

&gt; While no new patient clusters were reported on Tuesday, the existing cluster at S11 Dormitory in Punggol added 10 more cases. It now has 98 cases - the largest cluster here so far.

&gt; Five more cases are linked to Westlite Toh Guan dormitory, which now has 34 cases, while four more cases are linked to Toh Guan Dormitory, which now has 18 cases. Both dormitories are located in Toh Guan Road East.

&gt; On Monday, Toh Guan Dormitory was gazetted as an isolation area - the third foreign worker dormitory to receive this order after the S11 Dormitory and Westlite in Toh Guan. This means its workers will be quarantined in their rooms for 14 days.

&gt; The cluster with the biggest increase in linked cases on Tuesday was Sungei Tengah Lodge in Choa Chu Kang Road, which added 12 more cases for a total of 18 cases.

&gt; Other clusters at dormitories - Tampines Dormitory, Cochrane Lodge I and Cochrane Lodge II - also had more patients linked to them, adding between one to eight new cases.

&gt; Aside from the dormitory clusters, among the new cases announced are three women aged 88 to 97 who are part of the Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home cluster, which now has 16 cases.

&gt; MOH also gave updates on three patients from the public healthcare sector, who all had not travelled recently to countries or regions affected by the coronavirus outbreak.

&gt; One of them, announced on Monday, is a 22-year-old Singapore General Hospital nurse. She had not gone to work after she started showing symptoms last Saturday.

&gt; The second patient is another nurse, a 35-year-old woman from Ng Teng Fong General Hospital. She went to work for a few hours on Sunday, the same day she reported onset of symptoms.

&gt; The third patient is a 61-year-old healthcare assistant at Hougang Polyclinic. The woman did not go to work after she had symptoms last Wednesday.

&gt; MOH also said that 33 patients were discharged on Tuesday. To date, a total of 377 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.

&gt; Of the 627 confirmed cases still in hospital, most are stable or improving, with 29 in critical condition in the intensive care unit. Six have died from complications due to Covid-19 infection.

If I read correctly, 64 Italians might be COVID-19 carriers since they boarded less than 2 weeks ago. Not sure about the other nationalities, but COVID-19 is also present in their countries.


Will be interesting to see what Singapore decides. Refusing entry might expose a large amount of passengers, staff and crew exposed to a possible infection. Allowing entry might be a logistical nightmare, since all aboard would probably need to undergo 14 days quarantine.

8850,"Very stable as the necessity of logistical functions is fairly inelastic, even in the time of covid. 
However, turnover rate can be fairly high in some roles due to the stressful nature of some of the jobs. 

The roles in the logistics industry (freight forwarding, warehousing, transport etc.) 
are great entry level job and you can learn a lot. They also have relatively low competition for career growth
However,  the pay can be relatively low in the first few years and will have to deal with a lot of rudeness from both the customers and vendors. My observation is that people who often use operational roles to learn and then transition into different roles such as sales or something more specialised.

Supply/demand/production planner roles are relatively comfortable, provide good progression and have lesser day-to-day stress
But they can get monotonous, have more KPIs to hit and have greater stress coming from the potential repercussion of their mistakes (eg. Missed production having domino effect on the supply chain). 

Procurement roles often have a lot of overlap with planning roles and logistic roles. A lot of the Pros and cons are pretty similar to the planning roles.

9122,"I argue that Singapore needs an SDP, and by extension, Chee Soon Juan. 

The problem with CSJ was that his image is of a confrontational person with nothing to back it up. If you watch his rallies and his videos (one talking to the residents with the Bukit Batok GRCs), he is a competent person with heart and honestly to tackle problems within the GRC, and to be consistent and available in his GRCs (Like a full time MP).

The confrontational attitude is what separates the party from other parties like WP and PSP. In parliament, while the role of WP is to act as a shadow government, proposing alternate solutions, the role of SDP is to highlight problems in parliament with that confrontational tone that it is. This is reminiscent of American Democrats like Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, or Bernie Sanders.

If you look at SDP's members, they are competent and are of the level of WP's. We all know about Paul Tambyah. Benjamin Pwee was a senior political diplomat in Singapore's Foreign, Ministry, and contested in 211 under Chiam See Tong. Even Tan Jee Say is pretty stacked being with secretaries to Albert Winsemius and to Goh Chok Tong as well. Every party at this point has competent members to lead and as MPs. The problem is the timeframe of campaigning is too short, and it does not give you time to find out all its candidates.

The criticism to the ELD on the extension of time of voting isnt completely pointless, but a soundoff to their polling agents who have been on the ground since 5am. It is a last minute change that they were completely caught off guard by, as with the rest of the campaigning process (remember the chinese debate where WP didnt attend because of that same last min information?). Had they know that they would be staying till 10 from the start, SDP would have responded much differently. And polling day was extended to 10pm largely due to the mismanagement of polling crowds as seen on Polling day, especially in Sengkang. SDP is consistent in this regard because they didnt want the election during COVID due to safety reasons, and is rightly to criticize so.

Singapore doesnt like confrontational politics, and this is the reason why CSJ did not do as well. But that does not mean we do not need confrontational politics in parliament, as confrontational politics, helps to identify issues, and bring up issues that arent prevalent in the majority of Singapore. SDP and CSJ are important in this regard and the image of CSJ is the face of confrontational politics. They see CSJ as someone who will be willing to fight for Singapore due to his record and resilience in Politics. If you take away CSJ, it would be damaging to SDP's reputation.",17/7/2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hsodw0/chee_soon_juan_has_been_secgen_for_27_years/fycel3c/

&gt; SINGAPORE: Singapore reported 249 new COVID-19 infections as of noon on Wednesday (Jul 15), including 16 cases in the community and five imported cases, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in its preliminary update.

&gt; This brings the total number of cases in the country to 46,878.

&gt; All the community cases involve work pass holders. Four of them were close contacts of earlier cases and had already been placed on quarantine, said MOH.

&gt; Epidemiological investigations are ongoing for the other cases.

&gt; 

&gt; The five imported cases had been placed on stay-home notice upon their arrival in Singapore, MOH said.

&gt; 

&gt; The rest of the new cases are work permit holders residing in foreign worker dormitories.

&gt; The ministry said it will provide more details of the new cases on Wednesday night.

&gt; 

&gt; 

&gt; 

&gt; 

&gt; Singapore reported its 27th COVID-19 death on Tuesday – a 62-year-old man known as Case 17168.

&gt; The Singaporean was confirmed to have COVID-19 on Apr 30. He also had a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia.

&gt; On Tuesday as well, Singapore and Malaysia announced they are working to resume cross-border travel on Aug 10 for business travellers and residents on long-term passes, subject to precautionary measures.

&gt; Both countries have agreed to implement two schemes – the Reciprocal Green Lane and Periodic Commuting Arrangement – that target different groups of travellers.

&gt; Singapore is currently in Phase 2 of its reopening that began on Jun 19, with the gradual resumption of operations by more businesses.

9209,"&gt; My point was that a decade after SARS, and we have a stockpile of 5 million surgical masks. And you just proved my point when talking about the burn rate.

The recommendation following SARS was for only those who are sick to wear masks. Government seems to have stockpiled and reacted accordingly. 

&gt;Go listen to CCS's leaked audio recording regarding this. He literally said the only reason they discouraged masks was to slow the burn rate

The leaked audio is literally a snippet unless I missed a full recording somehwere. CCS could have been answering a specific question or addressed the health care concerns separately. Given this, I'd hesitate to make such a sweeping statement.

&gt; Such a straw man argument. Taiwan is also very reliant on trade relations. They banned mask exports. 

You're using strawman incorrectly. A strawman argument would be me trying to disprove a point you didn't make. For example if I suddenly argued with you about hand sanitisers or something. Anyway, I digress.

I already said I won't speculate on this issue. But consider that Taiwan's context is different. It is a social norm in Taiwan for sick people to wear masks. This means most households would already have some stock at home. 

&gt; The stockpile has nothing to do with hoarding. Because it is part of the strategic stockpile, they could have directed the supply any way they wish. They could have directed the public to use face coverings of any sort, which then leads to the last point.

You have a valid point here. However public shortage due to hoarding (which would happen once advice to wear any face mask is issued) would make it hard for masks to be properly distributed to the rest of the population, which was an essential first step to making masks mandatory. 

&gt; IDGAF about hoarding. Hoarders gonna hoard. The government's main concern should not have been ""oh people are going to hoard"". 

You cannot simply ignore inconvenient truths. Failure to plan is planning to fail.

&gt; What kind of leadership is that?

Pretty good leadership actually. You knew what the advice was, it was consistent, and public officials demonstrated leadership by walking the walk. There were frequent updates from the Ministers themselves. 

You may disagree with the actual decisions made, but the actual leadership at the time was solid.

Contrast this to the ""leadership"" of the Boris Johnson government, which was basically a big f you to the health care sector with their herd immunity ""plan"", or the Trump administration, which basically pretended COVID didn't exist.",13/7/2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hpw7sy/would_singapore_have_saved_at_least_200b_if_there/fxxlro3/

Technically SEA is leading in that regard, and doing so will help facilitate easier trade both within ASEAN and with China. I've read some of the reasons for it and its quite convincing. There are other considerations like cost-savings and transparency, so there's always more beneath the surface.

We can let the free market sort it out, but we risk losing ASEAN's lead because of slow implementation. Also despite the global slowdown in trade, the Covid situation only confirms why we need this. And if done correctly, means that we benefit while the elephants fight as trade gets funneled in.

9883,"&gt; # Singaporeans, PRs who travel from permitted countries can tap subsidies, MediShield Life for COVID-19 hospital bill

&gt; SINGAPORE: All Singaporeans, permanent residents and long-term pass holders who travel abroad under permitted travel arrangements with certain countries will be able to tap regular healthcare financing for their medical bills should they have symptoms of COVID-19 within 14 days of their return to Singapore.

&gt; “This means that Singaporeans and PRs will be eligible for government subsidies and MediShield Life integrated shield plan coverage,"" said Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong on Thursday (Aug 6).

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; “Long-term pass holders may tap on their prevailing financing arrangements, such as the foreign worker insurance. But any remaining co-payment will continue to be paid by the patient.”

&gt; This takes effect from Aug 7.

&gt; Currently, those who travel overseas against the travel advisories are required to pay for their own COVID-19 treatment in full should they have symptoms of the disease within 14 days of their return.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; But as Singapore gradually allows essential travel through various arrangements with certain countries, authorities have reviewed the charging policy for these travellers, Mr Gan said at a press conference by the multi-ministry task force on the pandemic.

&gt; The government subsidies and use of MediShield Life will apply to those who travel under green or fast lanes, as well as any permitted travel arrangement that may be implemented in the future, said the Ministry of Health (MOH).

&gt; ""Short-term pass holders entering Singapore under permitted travel arrangements will remain responsible for their medical bills should they test positive for COVID-19,"" the ministry added.

&gt; The Government will continue to closely monitor the number of imported cases, he added.

&gt; Mr Gan noted that the pandemic in other parts of the world “continues to accelerate”, and some countries that managed to control the initial wave of COVID-19 infections are now facing a resurgence in cases.

&gt; “In Asia, there have been worrying uptick in some areas, including Hong Kong, India, Japan, and Vietnam. Many Singaporeans are understandably concerned about imported cases,” said Mr Gan.

&gt; “But keeping our borders sealed is not a sustainable strategy, as many countries have also come to realise.”

&gt; Singapore has “taken a cautious approach” to facilitate the return of Singaporeans, PRs, long-term pass holders and work pass holders who are employed here, said Mr Gan, pointing out that all travellers receive stay-home notices upon their arrival and are tested before the end of their confinement period.

&gt; “All of our recent imported cases so far have been isolated or placed on SHN (stay-home notice). The risk of transmission to the community therefore continues to be very low,” said Mr Gan.

&gt; “But we will continue to monitor the imported cases very closely, as well as the global situation and adjust and update our border measures accordingly.”

&gt; Responding to a question on why travellers from Malaysia need only serve a stay-home notice of seven days - as compared with 14 days for those coming from other countries - Mr Gan said that Singapore takes into account the risk profile of the place a person travels from.

&gt; “We also take into account the mitigating measures that the other country, in this case Malaysia, has put in place,"" he said.

&gt; ""So we take a holistic assessment of the risk of travellers coming to Singapore and on the basis of the risk, we will then determine what are the precaution measures that we need to put in place, specifically on the SHN period.”

&gt; MOH’s director of medical services Kenneth Mak said the original 14-day stay-home notice was based on the maximum incubation period for the disease.

&gt; After several reviews, MOH found that travellers who were symptomatic typically presented with symptoms within five to six days of entering Singapore, said Assoc Prof Mak.

&gt; “That allowed us then to think about considering the shortening of the duration of SHN for countries where the original prevalence in that country was low,” he added.

&gt; The risk of missing a traveller - despite a shortened stay-home notice and then manifesting symptoms - becomes “quite low” with countries where the prevalence of COVID-19 is lower than in Singapore, said Assoc Prof Mak.

&gt; Malaysia reported 15 COVID-19 infections on Thursday, taking its tally to 9,038 COVID-19 cases.

&gt; Singapore reported 301 new cases on Thursday, taking its total number of infections to 54,555. The majority of the new cases are linked to foreign worker dormitories.

&gt; SINGAPORE - Six men and one woman, aged between 30 and 52, will be charged in court next Tuesday (June 2) for flouting circuit breaker regulations.

&gt; They are linked to the incident where groups of people were seen gathering at various places in the Robertson Quay area on May 16, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) said on Saturday.

&gt; These seven individuals will be charged under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020.

&gt; ""We take such breaches very seriously and will not hesitate to take action,"" Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli said in a Facebook post on Saturday.

&gt; Earlier this month, photos of crowds along Robertson Quay had circulated on social media, showing people failing to stay at least 1m from one another in the riverside dining enclave.

&gt; Most of the people pictured were not wearing masks, while some had their masks lowered as they spoke to one another.

&gt; On May 17, URA issued a directive to some restaurants at Robertson Quay, barring them from selling alcohol for takeaway with immediate effect, as the takeaway sales had contributed to more individuals gathering in the area.

&gt; URA and the police have since been investigating the matter.

&gt; As circuit breaker measures lift from June 2, more people will come in contact with one another, said Mr Masagos. ""It will be more critical than ever to practise safe distancing,"" he said.

&gt; Singaporeans must remain vigilant to curb the spread of Covid-19 despite the decreasing trend in the number of community transmissions, he added.

&gt; ""Stay home as far as possible. Wear a mask and keep a distance of at least 1 metre from the next person when you go out,"" Mr Masagos said.

&gt; ""We urge both the public and business operators to continue to play their part in adhering to the safe distancing measures that have been put in place,"" a URA spokesman said.

Quote from article: ""Large questions still remain over the true extent of the pathogen's spread. In April, a Tokyo hospital conducted tests on a handful of non-Covid patients and found that around 7 per cent had the coronavirus, showing the danger of missing asymptomatic or mild carriers that can become the source of an outbreak. An antibody test on 500 people in the capital suggested the true outbreak could be nearly 20 times larger than figures have shown. Analogue contact tracing breaks down when infection numbers are high, and reports of people unable to get tested or even medical treatment for Covid-like symptoms peppered social media during the height of the outbreak.""",25/5/2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gq0jps/did_japan_just_beat_the_coronavirus_without/frqp068/

Did you even read the paper?

They even **bolded** the relevant section in paragraph 6 for you.

6.	A surrogate marker of ‘viral load’ with PCR is the cycle threshold value (Ct). A low Ct value indicates a high viral RNA amount, and vice versa. As noted above, detection of viral RNA does not necessarily mean the presence of infectious or viable virus. In a local study from a multicenter cohort of 73 COVID-19 patients, **when the Ct value was 30 or higher (i.e. when viral load is low), no viable virus (based on being able to culture the virus) has been found**. In addition, **virus could not be isolated or cultured after day 11 of illness**. These data corroborate the epidemiologic data and indicate that while viral RNA detection may persist in some patients, such persistent RNA detection represent non-viable virus and such patients are non-infectious.",24/5/2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gp6yuo/covid19_patients_no_longer_infectious_11_days/frm9v9c/

&gt; SINGAPORE: Singapore reported 682 new COVID-19 cases as of noon on Sunday (May 17), taking the country's total to 28,038.

&gt; 

&gt; The vast majority of cases are work permit holders residing in foreign worker dormitories, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in its preliminary daily update.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; ​​​​​​​Four cases were Singaporeans or permanent residents.

&gt; More information on Sunday's cases will be provided later in the day, the ministry added.

&gt; On Saturday, Singapore reported its 22nd fatality from the disease.

&gt; The 67-year-old man, known as case 1516, had a a history of ischaemic heart disease, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; He was confirmed to have COVID-19 on Apr 7 and died on May 15.

&gt; 

&gt; 

&gt; 

&gt; 

&gt; 

&gt; As the number of community cases goes down to single digits, authorities have been easing some ""circuit breaker"" restrictions, such as allowing more businesses to reopen.

&gt; However, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong cautioned on Friday that the measures need to be lifted ""carefully and slowly"", as the number of COVID-19 community cases was ""likely"" to increase as some of the measures are rolled back.

&gt; 

&gt; “Because if we are not careful, the number of cases will spike up, and you may have big clusters forming again,"" he said.

10395,"&gt; # Where has all the flour gone?

&gt; A handwritten piece of paper, stuck on a box outside baking supplies store Phoon Huat in Toa Payoh, states that ingredients such as baking powder, baking soda and cocoa powder are out of stock.

&gt; The same ingredients are missing from many shelves in supermarkets and grocery stores across the island. Shops and retailers, however, insist there is sufficient stock.

&gt; The only problem: They cannot replenish shelves fast enough because of a baking frenzy brought on by the circuit breaker measures and Hari Raya Aidilfitri, which falls on May 24.

&gt; Meanwhile, at Phoon Huat in Toa Payoh, customers wait in line, getting their temperatures and identity cards checked before entering.

&gt; This is a typical scene at shops run by the Phoon Huat chain, which also owns the Redman by Phoon Huat outlets. As part of social distancing and contact tracing efforts, all 14 outlets have in place a queue management system and digital check-in system, SafeEntry.

&gt; The queue system requires an individual to give his or her mobile number to get a queue number via SMS stating the waiting time. Upon receiving a second SMS, customers can join a shorter queue to enter the shop.

&gt; But check the date before heading to a store. Entry is restricted by the last digit of one's NRIC number. For instance, if it is an odd number, an individual will be allowed entry only on odd-numbered dates.

&gt; Since April 27, the stores have also had shorter daily operating hours of 10am to 7pm - regular operating hours vary across outlets - due to manpower constraints arising from split-team operations.

&gt; A Phoon Huat spokesman says: ""We found the alternate visit dates effective for social distancing. The objective is to cut the number of customers by half.

&gt; 

&gt; Long queues at the Phoon Huat store in Toa Payoh on May 14. With more customers stocking up on baking supplies, the shop has run out of some ingredients. ST PHOTO: KUA CHEE SIONG

&gt; 

&gt; ""Our shops are small and with the limited (number of customers) allowed in each shop at any one time, we want to cut the queue and crowd (numbers) outside.""

&gt; Still, the measures have not stopped some of the stores' baking ingredients from running out fast.

&gt; With more time on their hands, more people are turning to baking - from homemade bread to the trendy Basque burnt cheesecake - during the circuit breaker period.

&gt; Says the Phoon Huat spokesman: ""We are unable to replenish stocks fast enough for retail customers. Whatever retail packs are produced daily are immediately sent to our shops twice a day.

&gt; ""For basic baking ingredients like flour and sugar, the supply is enough. It is the retail packing process we are trying our best to increase capacity for.""

&gt; Phoon Huat's production plant runs three daily shifts and it is looking to increase delivery slots with third-party logistics companies.

&gt; Supermarket chains are also racing to restock baking goods, for which there has been unprecedented demand.

&gt; At FairPrice outlets, sales of baking products ""have increased about threefold"" during the circuit breaker period compared with the same period last year, says a FairPrice spokesman. Sales have also jumped by 80 per cent in the weeks leading up to Hari Raya Aidilfitri, compared with the same period last year.

&gt; ""This has resulted in periodic disruption for some of these products such as flour, baking soda and instant yeast,"" adds the FairPrice spokesman. ""We have ramped up supplies and are purchasing from a wider pool of suppliers to provide more alternatives.""

&gt; Since the tighter circuit breaker measures were announced on April 21, grocery store The Source Bulk Foods has been selling 25kg of flour daily - five times the usual amount - and seen more demand for vanilla pods.

&gt; Home bakers who are unable to get sufficient baking supplies have had to make do with ingredients they already have.

&gt; Housewife Patricia Tan, 52, who bakes for family and friends, looked in vain for Philadelphia cream cheese for weeks and was unable to fulfil an order for a birthday cake.

&gt; She says: ""I did not want to use other brands because I cannot guarantee the quality.""

&gt; The avid baker of sourdough bread has been hunting for flour at different supermarkets and baking supplies stores, and has tried using flour from Vietnam which she bought at a FairPrice supermarket.

&gt; She says: ""I don't need yeast because I have a sourdough starter, but I can't do without flour. And for bread, you usually need bread flour that has high protein content.""

&gt; Cream cheese, baking chocolate and chiffon cake tins were missing from Mrs Michelle Wong's delivery from Phoon Huat's Redman online shop last Friday.

&gt; Only seven of her 15 items arrived. She was informed via e-mail that the rest were out of stock and she would receive a refund.

&gt; The mother of two children, aged eight and 11, ordered online as she did not want to leave them at home to go to the supermarket, especially since she would likely have had to stay in the queue for a while.

&gt; She says: ""I will just have to make do with whatever I have.""

&gt; SINGAPORE: The certificate of entitlement (COE) bidding exercises for April will be suspended, said the Land Transport Authority (LTA) in a media release on Sunday (Apr 5).

&gt; This as motor vehicle dealerships and showrooms will be closed during the period when enhanced safe distancing measures kick in from Apr 7 to May 4.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Announced on Friday by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, these measures will see all schools and workplaces - except for those providing essential services - be closed, as part of a month-long ""circuit breaker"" to stem the COVID-19 outbreak here.

&gt; LTA said it will continue to monitor the situation closely and update on subsequent bidding exercises.

&gt; Dealers may use their existing stock of Temporary COEs (TCOEs) to register new vehicles, it said.

&gt; A day earlier, LTA announced the suspension of Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) charges at all gantries from Monday on expectations that traffic will be significantly reduced following the closure of schools and most workplaces next week.

&gt; Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan said in a separate Facebook post on Saturday that he had asked LTA to suspend ERP charging in expectations that road traffic ""should plunge further"".

&gt; ""All gantries will stop charging for one month as we expect traffic to be light,"" he said.

&gt; ""Meanwhile, let’s cooperate with MOH: Stay home, stay safe and stay focused on keeping COVID at bay.""

The question has always been how is it that there was no regulatory oversight for the years and years before?

NGOs have highlighted this. Pritam has highlighted this in 2015. Medical experts have highlighted this. But all MOM did was to give awards to dorms and then claim that any attempt at regulation is unpopular.

Now there's a huge attempt to distance the self (gov't) from the other (dorm operators), and painting the former as heroes that actually cares and is doing something, while the latter as the main cause of the problem. Nevermind this only happened when shit hits the fan (exploding COVID numbers) and international attention. 

In reality we are *all* complicit: government, operators and voters. Some are more complicit than others (people who are either paid or made millions of dollars, for instance), but this issue will not be solved unless  the population actually makes this an issue they care about. Because if you're poor and if you can't vote, you're basically fucked.",24/4/2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/g6kdq1/a_slightly_more_positive_view_from_our_migrant/fodyqiq/

&gt;Taiwan—one of the world’s biggest suppliers of medical-grade masks and one of the few places to have successfully battled back COVID-19

https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/13/taiwan-coronavirus-pandemic-mask-soft-power-diplomacy/

&gt;Since January, Taiwan, India and Thailand, all of which also make face masks, have banned their export, although, to help China, India later temporarily revoked its restriction. South Korea also banned the export of masks, as will Indonesia soon.

https://theconversation.com/the-global-effort-to-tackle-the-coronavirus-face-mask-shortage-133656


I never said Taiwan had an easy time producing mask. I said Taiwan was a mask producing country so they already had the expertise and the know how. Taiwan is also heavy on manufacturing so they can convert existing sites/factories to produce mask which China and US had done. Singapore does not enjoy either of this.

Even if we started to produce out own mask(which we already are), there is no way to supply the entire country worth of mask. The masks produced locally would go straight to the frontlines and not to the masses. We would still be subjected to price gouging that we see today. 

It is simply not possible from a logistics standpoint to supply the entire country with enough masks even if we somehow manage to secure the machines, the rare material, etc. Manpower would still be an issue.",22/4/2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/g5cg0v/just_curious_how_many_of_you_especially_the/fo3jtxw/

If you look at the [MOH situation report](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report), the number of total cases outside of dorms has trended down since the start of the circuit breaker measures on April 7th.

&gt; Associate Professor Alex Cook, vice-dean of research at the National University of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said numbers the country has seen among foreign workers in dormitories in the past two weeks could point to at least 10,000 to 20,000 foreign worker patients as early as the end of April.

Secondly, news articles are often heavily editorialised, losing their nuance.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/no-proof-of-asymptomatic-transmission-of-coronavirus-ncid

Headline: ""No proof of asymptomatic transmission of coronavirus: NCID""

What was actually said: 

&gt;Dr Vasoo said that as far as is currently known, ""transmission is predominantly still through symptomatic persons"".

&gt;Some who are said to be ""asymptomatic"" may actually have ""mild symptoms that people do not make much of"", he said.

&gt;He added: ""While it is plausible that viral diseases may transmit in varying degrees and durations in the pre-symptomatic phase, we do not have robust data that it happens or to what extent it is for Covid-19.""

&gt;When asked about international reports of asymptomatic carriers of the virus, a Ministry of Health (MOH) spokesman on Monday (Feb 24) noted the case in Germany was later retracted and said it was aware of the case report from China.

&gt; Border restrictions

4.        Based on this latest situation, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce will put in place additional border restriction measures. From 16 March 2020, 2359 hours, all travellers (including Singapore Residents, Long Term Pass holders, and short-term visitors) entering Singapore with recent travel history to ASEAN countries[2], Japan, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom within the last 14 days will be issued with a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN).[3] In addition, they will have to provide proof of the place where they will serve the 14-day SHN, for example a hotel booking covering the entire period, or a place of residence they or their family members own. They may also be swabbed for testing for COVID-19, even if asymptomatic. This is because of the risk of community transmission in these countries and evidence of cases that have been imported from these countries into Singapore.

5.        In addition to the SHN requirement, from 16 March 2020, 2359 hours, all short-term visitors who are nationals of any ASEAN country will have to submit requisite information on their health to the Singapore Overseas Mission in the country they are resident before their intended date of travel. The submission will have to be approved by Singapore’s Ministry of Health (MOH) before travel to Singapore, and the approval will be verified by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officers at the Singapore checkpoints. Short-term visitors who arrive in Singapore without the necessary approval will be denied entry into Singapore.They are therefore advised to secure the approval before making definitive travel bookings.

6.        The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) will also introduce new measures for Foreign Domestic Workers entering Singapore. More details will be announced by MOM.

7.        As previously announced, residents and long-term pass holders returning from mainland China (outside Hubei province[4]), Iran, Italy, France, Germany, Republic of Korea, and Spain will continue to be issued a 14-day SHN upon return to Singapore, while short-term visitors from these areas will not be allowed to enter or transit through Singapore.

8.        All travellers entering Singapore and exhibiting fever and/or other symptoms of respiratory illness are required to undergo a COVID-19 swab test at the checkpoints, regardless of travel history. Such travellers will also be issued a 14-day SHN, which they will have to serve in full even if the result of the swab test is negative. Those who meet the clinical suspect case definition will be conveyed to the hospital for follow-up.

9.        Persons under SHN will have to remain in their place of residence at all times for 14 days after entering Singapore.

Getting rid of the top 3 SMCs that could fall to the opposition essentially inhibits further challenge in those wards while leaving Aljunied and Hougang untouched lets them claim that they're not gerrymandering - ""we're not touching the opposition territory what"". Furthermore, by changing those three SMCs to be GRCs prevents WP from assembling another A team, especially when Low Thia Kiang and Sylvia Lim's names have been plastered over the news in recent times. I see this as the PAP conceding a fighting chance for WP in their 6 seats but really making them fight for it. 

With PM allaying fears of DORSCON Red and ministers warning of DORSCON actually going down, this sets the stage for them to hold elections before COVID is fully eradicated. Calling it now, the second stimulus will come before National Day and PM will use National Day Rally to highlight how well the government is doing, to prepare for an election during the September holidays.

What I have for you though is this: Due to how Covid-19 has thrown pretty much all the economies around the world off balance, economists and analysts have all predicted the entire world to go into a deep recession that is likely to last even after the pandemic ends. So unless you die-die cannot last a day more at your current job, perhaps try to hang in there for now. This applies to everyone btw including those in the private sector.

&gt; SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) reported a preliminary 569 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Wednesday (3 June) noon, bringing the total to 36,405.

&gt; Of them, the vast majority are foreign workers living in dormitories, said the ministry.

&gt; “Based on our investigations so far, there are seven cases in the community, of whom one is a Singaporean/permanent resident and six are work pass holders,” it added.

&gt; The MOH said that more details will be provided in its press release issued at night.

&gt; MOH STATEMENT IN FULL

&gt; The MOH has been publishing a list of locations visited by cases in the community for over 30 minutes since last Monday.

&gt; This list – which excludes residences, workplaces, healthcare facilities, and public transport – will be updated on a rolling 14-day basis or one incubation period, the ministry said.

&gt; As a precautionary measure, the MOH advised those who had been at these locations during the specified timings to monitor their health closely for 14 days from their date of visit.

&gt; They have also been urged by the ministry to visit the doctor if they develop symptoms such as cough, sore throat, as well as fever and loss of taste or smell, and inform the doctor of their exposure history.

&gt; With 709 more patients discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities, a total of 23,175 – over 60 per cent of total cases here – here have fully recovered from the infection, said the MOH on Tuesday.

&gt; Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while six are in critical condition in the intensive care unit

&gt; Over 12,000 patients with mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

&gt; Apart from 24 patients who have died from COVID-19 complications, nine others who tested positive for the virus have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and two whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.

&gt; “Only cases where the attending doctor or pathologist attributes the primary or underlying cause of death as due to COVID-19 infection will be added to the COVID-19 death count,” said the MOH in previous press releases, adding that the method of assessment is consistent with international practices for classifying deaths.

&gt; As of 25 May, the ministry has conducted 334,691 swab tests, of which 218,996 were done on unique individuals. This translates to around 58,700 swabs conducted per 1 million total population, and about 38,400 unique individuals swabbed per 1 million total population.

&gt; For three months, Tan Tock Seng Hospital has been running tests 24/7 in the face of several challenges, from trying to ramp up capacity to warding off staff burnout, all while having to keep standards high.

&gt; SINGAPORE: For years, since the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Singapore ended, Tan Tock Seng Hospital’s department of laboratory medicine had been planning for another outbreak like it.

&gt; The plan was to equip the lab to do 500 tests per day at full capacity, in support of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; But in March, even before Singapore’s daily cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) peaked, the Ministry of Health asked the hospital to look into doing 3,000 tests a day, said TTSH head of laboratory medicine, Adjunct Assistant Professor Partha Pratim De.

&gt; It has been difficult, however, for the department to go from 500 tests a day to even 800, which is its maximum capacity now “with the amount of staff and equipment that we have"".

&gt; Dr Partha Pratim De.

&gt; “We’re trying to get staff from here, there and everywhere. We’re trying to get equipment from here, there and everywhere,” he added. “It’s very time-consuming and tiring, but everybody’s working hard in this situation.”

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Ramping up testing capabilities is just one of the challenges faced by his lab since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak.

&gt; With testing taking place 24/7, staff fatigue is another. And according to lab staff, the process itself is “quite tedious” as CNA Insider discovers in an inside look at how COVID-19 testing is done in TTSH.

&gt; “When you’re dealing with hundreds of samples in the middle of the night, every night, it’s very, very difficult,” said Partha De.

&gt; IT TAKES AT LEAST THREE HOURS

&gt; Singapore’s COVID-19 testing capacity has risen from a daily average of 2,900 tests early last month to more than 8,000. There are now a number of places — from hospitals to public and private labs — where samples are being tested.

&gt; At TTSH, the samples can come from nursing homes, some of the polyclinics and the Institute of Mental Health.

&gt; But the bulk come from across the road: Each day, porters carry hundreds of swab specimens in cooler boxes from the NCID to TTSH.

&gt; Once the samples are in the lab, “every step” taken by the staff becomes “crucial”, said Partha De. And it starts with ensuring that the label for each sample matches the patient in the lab’s information system.

&gt; A cooler box containing samples being opened in a safety cabinet.

&gt; “You get the wrong sample from the wrong patient at this stage, (and) it's a complete disaster,” added the doctor.

&gt; The test itself, called the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, is more than 99 per cent accurate in detecting the presence of the novel coronavirus (Sars-CoV-2). But it still requires every stage of the process to be executed properly.

&gt; The first stage is the extraction of nucleic acid from the samples. In the room where this is done, the samples are placed in biosafety cabinets that allow only inward airflow to keep any virus particles inside.

&gt; Lab staff operating the extractors must also wear personal protective equipment. Their safety tends not to weigh on their minds, however, as the extraction of viral material is a manual process that takes about 90 minutes and requires full concentration.

&gt; WATCH: How COVID-19 testing is done in Singapore (7:10)

&gt; The material must be extracted into a liquid, which is pipetted into a tube where chemicals known as reagents are used to isolate the COVID-19 viral genome, if it is present.

&gt; “Every step of the way, there are protocols to follow,” said medical technologist Nur Ain Lokman from the hospital’s microbiology lab. “Very small volumes of liquids to add ... and such, so one small mistake can affect the result.”

&gt; The second stage of the test is the detection phase, which takes another 90 minutes. Here, the extracted samples are mixed with another set of reagents and put in a machine where they are heated up and cooled down.

&gt; If the sample has the virus, a reaction would occur that results in the amplification of the viral genome, and thus a positive result is detected.

&gt; The machine amplifies the viral genome up to a billion times.

&gt; There are now four machines, each of which can test up to 96 samples. But because the swabs do not arrive all at once, some waiting may be needed and the time needed to report a test result ranges from three to eight hours.

&gt; Often, however, there are more samples coming in than the amount that can be tested immediately — a situation that medical technologist Tan Yong Wen described as “mentally taxing’.

&gt; “We have to get results fast for the clinicians,” he said. “When it’s a positive (result), it’s faster for them to do contact tracing, and so minimise the spread of the clusters.”

&gt; The testing work includes preparing the “master mix” of chemicals to load into the machine, which cannot be contaminated and must be calibrated according to the number of samples.

&gt; Adding the ""master mix"" to the samples.

&gt; When the workload is heavy, every detail requires even more focus. “The worst is when it’s 4am and you still have to concentrate very hard — because we really can’t afford to make any mistakes,” said medical technologist Chua Xian Da.

&gt; SMALL TEAM, SUPPLY LIMITATIONS

&gt; Ordinarily, the TTSH department of laboratory medicine receives samples mostly from patients to test their blood chemistry, for example, besides testing for communicable diseases like influenza and the Middle East respiratory syndrome, or for viruses such as Zika.

&gt; This routine lab work continues, although it has been scaled down from business as usual in tandem with the rest of the hospital’s services to focus on COVID-19.

&gt; At the start of the outbreak, TTSH had 13 lab technologists who were trained in the general PCR technique. But they needed training to do a specific PCR test for Sars-CoV-2 after China provided its exact genome sequence.

&gt; The team at work.

&gt; This diagnostic test, called the Fortitude Kit 2.0 and co-developed by the hospital and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research, was approved on Feb 7.

&gt; Soon, the workload at the lab went from a daily average of 250 tests to 370 for a brief period.

&gt; “That was roughly the second week of February, around Valentine’s Day, which everybody remembers for the wrong reasons in this hospital,” recalled Partha De.

&gt; The 12-hour night shifts were especially tiring.

&gt; “At that time ... the roster was such that (there was) one molecular medical technologist, alone, to process the samples throughout the night,” said Nur Ain. “That required a lot of endurance to sustain yourself, to be able to concentrate throughout.”

&gt; ""It’s not as simple as just testing that swab,"" said Nur Ain Lokman.

&gt; The number of night shifts they work has doubled to around four a month, said her colleague Chua. But the staff on duty at night has also doubled, which he reckoned is “better”.

&gt; Over the past three months, the team trained to run the RT-PCR test has gradually increased to 22. These include staff within the department, such as junior medical microbiologists, and volunteers with a lab background from other departments.

&gt; The training for each of them takes no less than two weeks. “It’s extremely specialised testing,” explained Partha De, who also hired four polytechnic graduates to be rostered only for the night shifts.

&gt; Referring to how the RT-PCR is different from rapid serology test kits launched in the market, he pointed out that the latter are blood tests.

&gt; “They detect the infection, but after 10 to 14 days of symptoms. That’s too slow,” he said. “The gold standard is still the PCR.”

&gt; Checking the results of the PCR test.

&gt; Increasing testing capacity is not, however, all about having trained manpower. Many countries, including Singapore, are facing a disruption to the supply of extraction reagents required for COVID-19 testing, with shortages mainly in Europe and the United States.

&gt; “It’s an international problem. The MOH and the Agency for Logistics Procurement and Supply are now coordinating nationally to distribute extraction equipment and reagent supplies,” said Partha De.

&gt; “We’re switching strategy to China, where they have more secure supply lines now that their epidemic problem isn’t as bad. And they’re able to restart factory production for reagents.”

&gt; Meanwhile, there has been a reduction in testing of NCID in-patients, who were previously “tested almost every day”, even if they had symptoms.

&gt; The National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) in Singapore on Apr 3, 2020. (Photo: AFP/Roslan Rahman)

&gt; “Because as soon as they've had two negative swabs, they can be discharged and the bed can be freed up for someone else. But we’ve had to help reduce that,” he added.

&gt; “We’re also changing practice based on evidence, so ... we can almost predict when the best time to take a swab is.”

&gt; Last month, his department tested a daily average of 420 samples for COVID-19, with the all-time high of 750 tests coming earlier, on March 23.

&gt; The lab is now getting more machines and trying out new automations to cut testing times, increase capacity and reduce some of the work done now, such as to manually open each sample tube and add the reagent mixture.

&gt; “Otherwise ... we'd begin to see staff fatigue and burnout quite rapidly,” said Partha De.

12540,"&gt; # Coronavirus: 2 new cases confirmed with no previous links, 4 more discharged

&gt; SINGAPORE - Two new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) were confirmed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Wednesday (Feb 26) and four others have recovered and were discharged.

&gt; This brings the total number of cases here to 93, of which 62 have fully recovered.

&gt; The ministry said most of the 31 still in hospital are in stable condition or improving, but seven are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

&gt; The new cases include two Singaporean men, aged 47 and 38, who do not have any recent travel history to China.

&gt; Both were confirmed to have the virus on Wednesday morning.

&gt; Case 92, a 47-year-old, is warded in an isolation room at Sengkang General Hospital while case 93, the 38-year-old, is warded at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital.

&gt; The ministry said contact tracing is under way to establish if the pair have any links to previous cases.

12542,"&gt; # Coronavirus: Chinese couple charged under Infectious Diseases Act for giving false information to MOH officials

&gt; SINGAPORE - Two individuals have been charged under the Infectious Diseases Act for giving false information to officials from the Ministry of Health (MOH) and obstructing the conduct of contact tracing.

&gt; They are Hu Jun, a 38 year-old male Chinese national from Wuhan, China, and his wife Shi Sha, a 36 year-old female Chinese national who resides in Singapore.

&gt; Hu arrived in Singapore on Jan 22 and was confirmed to be infected with Covid-19 on Jan 31. Shi had been identified as a close contact of Hu and was issued a Quarantine Order on Feb 1.

&gt; Hu has since fully recovered from the infection and had been discharged from hospital on Feb 19.

&gt; Once a Covid-19 case is confirmed, MOH initiates contact tracing to identify individuals who may have been exposed to the case while he/she was symptomatic.

&gt; Close contacts are monitored closely and may be quarantined, so that they can be identified and treated early if they develop the disease. This measure also prevents close contacts from mingling in the community if they become symptomatic, and helps to contain further transmission of Covid-19.

&gt; Both Hu and Shi had given false information to MOH officials about their movements and whereabouts from Jan 22 to Jan 29 when they were contacted for the purposes of contact tracing. Shi had also provided false information while under quarantine. However MOH was able to establish their true movements through detailed investigations.

&gt; In view of the potentially serious repercussions of the false information given by the defendants, and the risk they could have posed to public health, MOH has served Hu and Shi charges on Feb 25. The case will be heard in Court on Feb 28.

12543,"&gt; # Temasek to freeze wages; senior management to take voluntary pay cut

&gt; Singapore 

&gt; AMID the challenging situation resulting from the Covid-19 disease outbreak, Singapore state investment firm Temasek is implementing a firm-wide wage freeze and asking senior management to take a voluntary pay cut for up to a year.

&gt; In its compensation exercise this April, Temasek will freeze all salaries and promotion increases, and partially cut annual bonuses for the senior management team this year. It has also asked senior management to voluntarily reduce their base salaries by up to 5 per cent.

&gt; Temasek said that the budget originally set aside for the salary and promotion increases will be donated to its staff volunteer initiative T-Touch and set aside to support the community as needed during this time. The voluntary base salary reduction from senior management will be matched dollar-for-dollar by Temasek and donated to the same initiative.

&gt; Temasek has implemented wage freezes at other times in the past, such as during the Sars outbreak in 2003 and the global financial crisis in 2008. The Business Times understands that the investment firm does so in order to exercise restraint and prudence as a responsible portfolio owner in challenging times, but does not dictate whether its portfolio companies are to follow suit with wage freezes of their own.

&gt; Employees at the Environment Building were evacuated on Feb. 14 morning, according to Lianhe Zaobao.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; The brief Chinese report said the evacuation was after the discovery of a Covid-19 case, which is possibly a confirmed case.

&gt; Environment Building, which is located in Newton, includes the offices of the Ministry of Environment and Water Resources, National Environment Agency and Public Utilities Board.

&gt; Apart from evacuation, Zaobao understands that some of the agencies at the building have already begun to split their teams up into different groups.

&gt; Mothership understands that employees working on level nine were told to evacuate.

&gt; It is unclear if more than one level was affected.

&gt; This is a developing story.

&gt; We have reached out to MEWR and PUB for more information.

12737,"I personally don’t think the “rally around the flag” effect is that straight forward here... I have a suspicion that there’s a mix of sentiments out there, and it’s not going to be that much of a landslide. 

The way I see it, is that this ultimately depends if the PAP is judged to have handled the crisis well - And that depends on whether you are doing fine in spite of covid or got retrenched / closed business / lost income etc., 

AND all of this is also judged in comparison with other countries who did better than us, and got out of lockdown before us for e.g. (whether or not it’s judged correctly, is another thing)

But I say this because I see this divide in various social circles: The ones with cushy MNC / Big Tech / bank / Telco jobs seem to think that everything is fine / applaud the government’s efforts, while struggling people who had lost income (esp SME’s, tourism, F&amp;B, physical events) aren’t as happy with life atm, and blame the government (for messing up the dorm situation and prolonging CB) / want change.

&gt; SINGAPORE: Singapore reported 544 new COVID-19 cases as of noon on Tuesday (Jun 2), bringing the nation's total to 35,836.

&gt; 

&gt; There are four cases in the community, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in its preliminary daily update. Of these, one is a Singaporean or permanent resident while three are work pass holders.

&gt; Further details will be shared later in the day, the ministry added.

&gt; This is the first day after the end of the ""circuit breaker"" period. Businesses that operate in settings with lower transmission risks were allowed to reopen, and some students were back at school.

&gt; 

&gt; 

&gt;

&gt; Full hairdressing services, motor vehicle servicing, aircon servicing, printing, basic pet services and school bookshops have also been allowed to resume as part of Phase 1 of reopening after the circuit breaker.

&gt; Pre-schools and early intervention centres reopened for children in Kindergarten 1 and 2, with children in nursery level, infant care and playgroup to follow next week.

&gt; 

&gt; Some places of worship were also allowed to resume services such as marriage solemnisations and funerals, subject to a cap of 10 attendees.

&gt; Private worship at mosques will also be allowed in limited prayer spaces, which can accommodate up to five individuals, or up to five households with a maximum of five individuals per household.

&gt; Households may now visit parents or grandparents, subject to a limit of two people and one visit per day. Parents may also drop off children for childcare, subject to the same limit.

&gt;In a press conference on Apr. 9, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that if he had known about how cases in foreign worker dormitories would later ""explode"" into big clusters, he would have done things differently.

https://mothership.sg/2020/04/lawrence-wong-do-things-differently-foreign-workers/

So basically any policy they made that went wrong, can be because they don't have the ""benefit of hindsight"".

Maybe they should read more news like this one:

&gt;Responding to reports that two dormitories for migrant workers in Singapore have been designated as “isolation areas” and that over 20,000 of them have been put under quarantine there, Rachel Chhoa-Howard, Amnesty International’s Singapore Researcher said:

&gt;“The rapid spread of COVID-19 among migrant workers in Singapore was already alarming. The fact that thousands are now under quarantine in extremely close proximity could be a recipe for disaster, unless their basic rights are respected.

12982,"&gt; # 'We can’t afford to make any mistake’: Inside a COVID-19 testing lab in Singapore

&gt; For three months, Tan Tock Seng Hospital has been running tests 24/7 in the face of several challenges, from trying to ramp up capacity to warding off staff burnout, all while having to keep standards high.

&gt; SINGAPORE: For years, since the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Singapore ended, Tan Tock Seng Hospital’s department of laboratory medicine had been planning for another outbreak like it.

&gt; The plan was to equip the lab to do 500 tests per day at full capacity, in support of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; But in March, even before Singapore’s daily cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) peaked, the Ministry of Health asked the hospital to look into doing 3,000 tests a day, said TTSH head of laboratory medicine, Adjunct Assistant Professor Partha Pratim De.

&gt; It has been difficult, however, for the department to go from 500 tests a day to even 800, which is its maximum capacity now “with the amount of staff and equipment that we have"".

&gt; Dr Partha Pratim De.

&gt; “We’re trying to get staff from here, there and everywhere. We’re trying to get equipment from here, there and everywhere,” he added. “It’s very time-consuming and tiring, but everybody’s working hard in this situation.”

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Ramping up testing capabilities is just one of the challenges faced by his lab since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak.

&gt; With testing taking place 24/7, staff fatigue is another. And according to lab staff, the process itself is “quite tedious” as CNA Insider discovers in an inside look at how COVID-19 testing is done in TTSH.

&gt; “When you’re dealing with hundreds of samples in the middle of the night, every night, it’s very, very difficult,” said Partha De.

&gt; IT TAKES AT LEAST THREE HOURS

&gt; Singapore’s COVID-19 testing capacity has risen from a daily average of 2,900 tests early last month to more than 8,000. There are now a number of places — from hospitals to public and private labs — where samples are being tested.

&gt; At TTSH, the samples can come from nursing homes, some of the polyclinics and the Institute of Mental Health.

&gt; But the bulk come from across the road: Each day, porters carry hundreds of swab specimens in cooler boxes from the NCID to TTSH.

&gt; Once the samples are in the lab, “every step” taken by the staff becomes “crucial”, said Partha De. And it starts with ensuring that the label for each sample matches the patient in the lab’s information system.

&gt; A cooler box containing samples being opened in a safety cabinet.

&gt; “You get the wrong sample from the wrong patient at this stage, (and) it's a complete disaster,” added the doctor.

&gt; The test itself, called the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, is more than 99 per cent accurate in detecting the presence of the novel coronavirus (Sars-CoV-2). But it still requires every stage of the process to be executed properly.

&gt; The first stage is the extraction of nucleic acid from the samples. In the room where this is done, the samples are placed in biosafety cabinets that allow only inward airflow to keep any virus particles inside.

&gt; Lab staff operating the extractors must also wear personal protective equipment. Their safety tends not to weigh on their minds, however, as the extraction of viral material is a manual process that takes about 90 minutes and requires full concentration.

&gt; The material must be extracted into a liquid, which is pipetted into a tube where chemicals known as reagents are used to isolate the COVID-19 viral genome, if it is present.

&gt; “Every step of the way, there are protocols to follow,” said medical technologist Nur Ain Lokman from the hospital’s microbiology lab. “Very small volumes of liquids to add ... and such, so one small mistake can affect the result.”

&gt; The second stage of the test is the detection phase, which takes another 90 minutes. Here, the extracted samples are mixed with another set of reagents and put in a machine where they are heated up and cooled down.

&gt; If the sample has the virus, a reaction would occur that results in the amplification of the viral genome, and thus a positive result is detected.

&gt; The machine amplifies the viral genome up to a billion times.

&gt; There are now four machines, each of which can test up to 96 samples. But because the swabs do not arrive all at once, some waiting may be needed and the time needed to report a test result ranges from three to eight hours.

&gt; Often, however, there are more samples coming in than the amount that can be tested immediately — a situation that medical technologist Tan Yong Wen described as “mentally taxing’.

&gt; “We have to get results fast for the clinicians,” he said. “When it’s a positive (result), it’s faster for them to do contact tracing, and so minimise the spread of the clusters.”

&gt; The testing work includes preparing the “master mix” of chemicals to load into the machine, which cannot be contaminated and must be calibrated according to the number of samples.

&gt; Adding the ""master mix"" to the samples.

&gt; When the workload is heavy, every detail requires even more focus. “The worst is when it’s 4am and you still have to concentrate very hard — because we really can’t afford to make any mistakes,” said medical technologist Chua Xian Da.

&gt; SMALL TEAM, SUPPLY LIMITATIONS

&gt; Ordinarily, the TTSH department of laboratory medicine receives samples mostly from patients to test their blood chemistry, for example, besides testing for communicable diseases like influenza and the Middle East respiratory syndrome, or for viruses such as Zika.

&gt; This routine lab work continues, although it has been scaled down from business as usual in tandem with the rest of the hospital’s services to focus on COVID-19.

&gt; At the start of the outbreak, TTSH had 13 lab technologists who were trained in the general PCR technique. But they needed training to do a specific PCR test for Sars-CoV-2 after China provided its exact genome sequence.

&gt; The team at work.

&gt; This diagnostic test, called the Fortitude Kit 2.0 and co-developed by the hospital and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research, was approved on Feb 7.

&gt; Soon, the workload at the lab went from a daily average of 250 tests to 370 for a brief period.

&gt; “That was roughly the second week of February, around Valentine’s Day, which everybody remembers for the wrong reasons in this hospital,” recalled Partha De.

&gt; The 12-hour night shifts were especially tiring.

&gt; “At that time ... the roster was such that (there was) one molecular medical technologist, alone, to process the samples throughout the night,” said Nur Ain. “That required a lot of endurance to sustain yourself, to be able to concentrate throughout.”

&gt; ""It’s not as simple as just testing that swab,"" said Nur Ain Lokman.

&gt; The number of night shifts they work has doubled to around four a month, said her colleague Chua. But the staff on duty at night has also doubled, which he reckoned is “better”.

&gt; Over the past three months, the team trained to run the RT-PCR test has gradually increased to 22. These include staff within the department, such as junior medical microbiologists, and volunteers with a lab background from other departments.

&gt; The training for each of them takes no less than two weeks. “It’s extremely specialised testing,” explained Partha De, who also hired four polytechnic graduates to be rostered only for the night shifts.

&gt; Referring to how the RT-PCR is different from rapid serology test kits launched in the market, he pointed out that the latter are blood tests.

&gt; “They detect the infection, but after 10 to 14 days of symptoms. That’s too slow,” he said. “The gold standard is still the PCR.”

&gt; Checking the results of the PCR test.

&gt; Increasing testing capacity is not, however, all about having trained manpower. Many countries, including Singapore, are facing a disruption to the supply of extraction reagents required for COVID-19 testing, with shortages mainly in Europe and the United States.

&gt; “It’s an international problem. The MOH and the Agency for Logistics Procurement and Supply are now coordinating nationally to distribute extraction equipment and reagent supplies,” said Partha De.

&gt; “We’re switching strategy to China, where they have more secure supply lines now that their epidemic problem isn’t as bad. And they’re able to restart factory production for reagents.”

&gt; Meanwhile, there has been a reduction in testing of NCID in-patients, who were previously “tested almost every day”, even if they had symptoms.

&gt; “Because as soon as they've had two negative swabs, they can be discharged and the bed can be freed up for someone else. But we’ve had to help reduce that,” he added.

&gt; “We’re also changing practice based on evidence, so ... we can almost predict when the best time to take a swab is.”

&gt; Last month, his department tested a daily average of 420 samples for COVID-19, with the all-time high of 750 tests coming earlier, on March 23.

&gt; The lab is now getting more machines and trying out new automations to cut testing times, increase capacity and reduce some of the work done now, such as to manually open each sample tube and add the reagent mixture.

&gt; “Otherwise ... we'd begin to see staff fatigue and burnout quite rapidly,” said Partha De.

12986,"&gt; # 'We can’t afford to make any mistake’: Inside a COVID-19 testing lab in Singapore

&gt; For three months, Tan Tock Seng Hospital has been running tests 24/7 in the face of several challenges, from trying to ramp up capacity to warding off staff burnout, all while having to keep standards high.

&gt; SINGAPORE: For years, since the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Singapore ended, Tan Tock Seng Hospital’s department of laboratory medicine had been planning for another outbreak like it.

&gt; The plan was to equip the lab to do 500 tests per day at full capacity, in support of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).

&gt; But in March, even before Singapore’s daily cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) peaked, the Ministry of Health asked the hospital to look into doing 3,000 tests a day, said TTSH head of laboratory medicine, Adjunct Assistant Professor Partha Pratim De.

&gt; It has been difficult, however, for the department to go from 500 tests a day to even 800, which is its maximum capacity now “with the amount of staff and equipment that we have"".

&gt; Dr Partha Pratim De.

&gt; “We’re trying to get staff from here, there and everywhere. We’re trying to get equipment from here, there and everywhere,” he added. “It’s very time-consuming and tiring, but everybody’s working hard in this situation.”

&gt; Ramping up testing capabilities is just one of the challenges faced by his lab since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak.

&gt; With testing taking place 24/7, staff fatigue is another. And according to lab staff, the process itself is “quite tedious” as CNA Insider discovers in an inside look at how COVID-19 testing is done in TTSH.

&gt; “When you’re dealing with hundreds of samples in the middle of the night, every night, it’s very, very difficult,” said Partha De.

&gt; IT TAKES AT LEAST THREE HOURS

&gt; Singapore’s COVID-19 testing capacity has risen from a daily average of 2,900 tests early last month to more than 8,000. There are now a number of places — from hospitals to public and private labs — where samples are being tested.

&gt; At TTSH, the samples can come from nursing homes, some of the polyclinics and the Institute of Mental Health.

&gt; But the bulk come from across the road: Each day, porters carry hundreds of swab specimens in cooler boxes from the NCID to TTSH.

&gt; Once the samples are in the lab, “every step” taken by the staff becomes “crucial”, said Partha De. And it starts with ensuring that the label for each sample matches the patient in the lab’s information system.

&gt; A cooler box containing samples being opened in a safety cabinet.

&gt; “You get the wrong sample from the wrong patient at this stage, (and) it's a complete disaster,” added the doctor.

&gt; The test itself, called the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, is more than 99 per cent accurate in detecting the presence of the novel coronavirus (Sars-CoV-2). But it still requires every stage of the process to be executed properly.

&gt; The first stage is the extraction of nucleic acid from the samples. In the room where this is done, the samples are placed in biosafety cabinets that allow only inward airflow to keep any virus particles inside.

&gt; Lab staff operating the extractors must also wear personal protective equipment. Their safety tends not to weigh on their minds, however, as the extraction of viral material is a manual process that takes about 90 minutes and requires full concentration.

&gt; The material must be extracted into a liquid, which is pipetted into a tube where chemicals known as reagents are used to isolate the COVID-19 viral genome, if it is present.

&gt; “Every step of the way, there are protocols to follow,” said medical technologist Nur Ain Lokman from the hospital’s microbiology lab. “Very small volumes of liquids to add ... and such, so one small mistake can affect the result.”

&gt; The second stage of the test is the detection phase, which takes another 90 minutes. Here, the extracted samples are mixed with another set of reagents and put in a machine where they are heated up and cooled down.

&gt; If the sample has the virus, a reaction would occur that results in the amplification of the viral genome, and thus a positive result is detected.

&gt; The machine amplifies the viral genome up to a billion times.

&gt; There are now four machines, each of which can test up to 96 samples. But because the swabs do not arrive all at once, some waiting may be needed and the time needed to report a test result ranges from three to eight hours.

&gt; Often, however, there are more samples coming in than the amount that can be tested immediately — a situation that medical technologist Tan Yong Wen described as “mentally taxing’.

&gt; “We have to get results fast for the clinicians,” he said. “When it’s a positive (result), it’s faster for them to do contact tracing, and so minimise the spread of the clusters.”

&gt; The testing work includes preparing the “master mix” of chemicals to load into the machine, which cannot be contaminated and must be calibrated according to the number of samples.

&gt; Adding the ""master mix"" to the samples.

&gt; When the workload is heavy, every detail requires even more focus. “The worst is when it’s 4am and you still have to concentrate very hard — because we really can’t afford to make any mistakes,” said medical technologist Chua Xian Da.

&gt; SMALL TEAM, SUPPLY LIMITATIONS

&gt; Ordinarily, the TTSH department of laboratory medicine receives samples mostly from patients to test their blood chemistry, for example, besides testing for communicable diseases like influenza and the Middle East respiratory syndrome, or for viruses such as Zika.

&gt; This routine lab work continues, although it has been scaled down from business as usual in tandem with the rest of the hospital’s services to focus on COVID-19.

&gt; At the start of the outbreak, TTSH had 13 lab technologists who were trained in the general PCR technique. But they needed training to do a specific PCR test for Sars-CoV-2 after China provided its exact genome sequence.

&gt; The team at work.

&gt; This diagnostic test, called the Fortitude Kit 2.0 and co-developed by the hospital and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research, was approved on Feb 7.

&gt; Soon, the workload at the lab went from a daily average of 250 tests to 370 for a brief period.

&gt; “That was roughly the second week of February, around Valentine’s Day, which everybody remembers for the wrong reasons in this hospital,” recalled Partha De.

&gt; The 12-hour night shifts were especially tiring.

&gt; “At that time ... the roster was such that (there was) one molecular medical technologist, alone, to process the samples throughout the night,” said Nur Ain. “That required a lot of endurance to sustain yourself, to be able to concentrate throughout.”

&gt; ""It’s not as simple as just testing that swab,"" said Nur Ain Lokman.

&gt; The number of night shifts they work has doubled to around four a month, said her colleague Chua. But the staff on duty at night has also doubled, which he reckoned is “better”.

&gt; Over the past three months, the team trained to run the RT-PCR test has gradually increased to 22. These include staff within the department, such as junior medical microbiologists, and volunteers with a lab background from other departments.

&gt; The training for each of them takes no less than two weeks. “It’s extremely specialised testing,” explained Partha De, who has also hired four polytechnic graduates to be rostered only for the night shifts.

&gt; Referring to how the RT-PCR is different from rapid serology test kits launched in the market, he pointed out that the latter are blood tests.

&gt; “They detect the infection, but after 10 to 14 days of symptoms. That’s too slow,” he said. “The gold standard is still the PCR.”

&gt; Checking the results of the PCR test.

&gt; Increasing testing capacity is not, however, all about having trained manpower. Many countries, including Singapore, are facing a disruption in the availability of extraction reagents required for COVID-19 testing, with supply shortages mainly in Europe and the United States.

&gt; “It’s an international problem. The MOH and the Agency for Logistics Procurement and Supply are now coordinating nationally to distribute extraction equipment and reagent supplies,” said Partha De.

&gt; “We’re switching strategy to China, where they have more secure supply lines now that their epidemic problem isn’t as bad. And they’re able to restart factory production for reagents.”

&gt; Meanwhile, there has been a reduction in testing of NCID in-patients, who were previously “tested almost every day”, even if they had symptoms.
