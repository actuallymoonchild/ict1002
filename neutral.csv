Right now Japan doesn't even allow visa holders in, only nationals and residents and they have to quarantine.

Does anyone reckon that there could be a possibility that modelling based on cases everyday and hospitalisation rates (ICU and non ICU cases) will help guide decisions on whether we can decide when to tighten restrictions?

Say could we use ML to train models - cases everyday can be analysed based on composition and risk factors (age profile, co-morbidities which lead to severe cases and vaccination/not completely vaccinated) and project the rate of severe cases within the immediate days to help facilitate policy making?

112,"> # Mall retailers unsure how Covid-19 rules for the unvaccinated will work, expect to see losses

> SINGAPORE - Mall-based businesses are seeking more clarity on how vaccination-differentiated safe management measures will be implemented once the ban on unvaccinated people from shopping centres kicks in on Wednesday (Oct 13).

> They want to know if unvaccinated staff can still work at outlets inside malls if they undergo fast and easy rostered routine testing.

> The Government announced last Saturday (Oct 9) that those unvaccinated against Covid-19 can no longer enter shopping malls and large standalone stores that are not supermarkets from this Wednesday.

> However, entry will still be allowed for unvaccinated recovered Covid-19 individuals or children aged 12 and below, or those who have a valid negative pre-event test result.

> The latter, however, has also been met with questions about what forms of pre-event testing are accepted.

> The Government said on Sunday that an advisory with more details will be issued before the new measures kick in on Wednesday, and that there will be a one-week grace period from Oct 13 for these measures to be implemented at shopping malls.

> The Ministry of Health said last Saturday that the vaccination-differentiation rules will protect unvaccinated individuals in the community and reduce the strain on the healthcare system.

> This came as daily cases last week crossed the 3,000 mark for five consecutive days until Sunday, when they fell to 2,809 - likely due to fewer swabs being done over the weekend.

> The new rules, however, have businesses worried.

> Mr Pang Fu Wei, managing director of Mothercare Singapore, said: ""Some pregnant women - who are our core demographic - are still unvaccinated because doing so comes with a risk.""

> He said that the firm's 11 stores islandwide have seen fewer shoppers since National Day, when Covid-19 cases began climbing.

> While walk-ins over the weekend did not dip, he told The Straits Times he is worried business will fall from Wednesday.

> Ms June Tham, 28, a therapist at beauty salon Brow Art Asia at the Hillion Mall outlet, said she received five cancellations over the weekend for appointments this week, including some from unvaccinated customers.

> She said: ""For facials, you need to be vaccinated or have a negative Covid-19 result. But very few people would bring a test result and don't even know that it is accepted.""

> Other businesses are taking steps so they can continue serving unvaccinated customers.

> Ms Laurelle Lim, 26, an administrator at Cristofori Music School's outlet in Hillion Mall, said: ""Some of our students can continue with online classes, since they have pianos at home.

> ""They can also attend classes in our outlets located in Housing Board (HDB) estates.""

> Even as businesses seek to provide their unvaccinated customers with alternatives, some customers feel that the new measures are too stringent.

> Mr Timothy Yeo, 39, who has not been vaccinated, said: ""Even bringing my five-year-old daughter into the mall for enrichment classes might be an issue now. To do a pre-event test just for that is not viable.""

> Mr Yeo, who works in the aviation industry, said he is waiting to take the Novavax vaccine as he does not want to take a mRNA one.

> He hopes that more essential services such as banks, barbers and supermarkets within malls will be added to the list of places exempted from the new measures.

> He said: ""I feel that it has come to the point where getting vaccinated is forced. If I want to have any semblance of life, I would have no option but to get vaccinated.""

> Strategy professor Lawrence Loh from the National University of Singapore Business School said it is important to balance both collective safety and individual needs when further details on the differentiated rules are announced.

> Prof Loh said: ""People can buy food at hawker centres and coffee shops. But for those who have been seeing the same doctor at the same clinic for years, it's important they can continue doing so.""

I don't think there's a need to carry on with contact tracing as long as the vaccine remains somewhat effective against SARS-CoV2.

> GENEVA: The World Health Organziation said on Monday (May 10) that the coronavirus variant first identified in India last year was being classified as a variant of global concern, with some preliminary studies showing that it spreads more easily.

> The B1617 variant is the fourth variant to be designated as being of global concern and requiring heightened tracking and analysis. The others are those first detected in Britain, South Africa and Brazil.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""We are classifying this as a variant of concern at a global level,"" Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO technical lead on COVID-19, told a briefing. ""There is some available information to suggest increased transmissibility.""

> Indian coronavirus infections and deaths held close to record daily highs on Monday, increasing calls for the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to lock down the world's second-most populous country.

> The WHO has said the predominant lineage of B1617 was first identified in India in December, although an earlier version was spotted in October 2020.

> The variant has already spread to other countries, and many nations have moved to cut or restrict movements from India.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Van Kerkhove said more information about the variant and its three sub-lineages would be made available on Tuesday.

> ""Even though there is increased transmissibility demonstrated by some preliminary studies, we need much more information about this virus variant and this lineage and all of the sub-lineages,"" she said.

> Soumya Swaminathan, WHO chief scientist, said studies were under way in India to examine the variant's transmissibility, the severity of disease it causes and the response of antibodies in people who have been vaccinated.

> Advertisement

> ""What we know now is that the vaccines work, the diagnostics work, the same treatments that are used for the regular virus works, so there is really no need to change any of those,"" Swaminathan said.

> WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the WHO Foundation was launching a ""Together for India"" appeal to raise funds to purchase oxygen, medicines and protective equipment for health workers.

275,"> # Immunity from Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine wanes months after 2nd shot, with more men at risk: Study

> JERUSALEM (BLOOMBERG) - Immunity provided by the Covid-19 vaccine from partners Pfizer and BioNTech weakens significantly within months, with men having less protection than women, according to research that supports the use of booster doses.

> Protective antibodies decreased continuously during the six months after the administration of the second dose of the vaccine, according to a study of about 5,000 Israeli health workers, published Wednesday (Oct 6) in the New England Journal of Medicine. The levels fell first at a sharp pace and later at a more moderate one.

> Researchers worldwide are trying to identify the critical threshold of antibodies needed to prevent coronavirus infection, severe illness and death, said Dr Gili Regev-Yochay, one of the authors of the study.

> Such studies will help assess risk levels for various groups and the measures needed to protect them, the researcher said.

> Antibody levels were found to be lower in older people than in younger, and in immunosuppressed individuals compared to the healthy population, according to the study from Sheba Medical Centre in Ramat Gan.

> Men's antibody counts were lower than those of women both at their peak and at the end of the study.

> The research shows why there are breakthrough infections in individuals who have had two vaccine doses, Dr Regev-Yochay said in an online press briefing.

> The US, which has restricted its booster recommendation to older people and other vulnerable groups, will likely follow Israel's decision to offer a third dose to the entire population, she said.

> ""I would be more than surprised if we are not going to start to see a lot of breakthrough infections in the United States,"" among those who have received just two doses, Dr Regev-Yochay said.

> The Israel findings were bolstered by a second real-world study from Qatar, published in the same journal, that found the efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot faded over a similar time period.

> Protection fell from 77.5 per cent during the first month after the second dose to 20 per cent in months five to seven after the second dose.

> Still, the research found, prevention of severe and fatal infections remained strong throughout the study period, reaching 96 per cent in the first two months after the second dose and persisting at roughly this level for six months.

> ""The data is consistent,"" said Dr Laith Abu-Raddad, a coauthor of the paper who studies infectious disease epidemiology at Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar. ""Protection against hospitalisation and death is really strong and more durable than protection against infection.""

> Giving a third booster shot helps optimise the protection from the vaccine, he said.

> Two other studies from Israel published in the journal also followed up on early reports of heart inflammation following vaccination.

> Cases of inflammation, called myocarditis, although rare, increased after the receipt of the vaccine, according to one study by the Israeli Health Ministry and Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Centre, particularly after the second dose among young male recipients.

> While cases were usually mild, one was fatal.

> Another study by the Clalit Health Services, the largest healthcare system in the country, found that the estimated incidence of myocarditis was 2.13 cases per 100,000 persons.

> The highest incidence was among male patients between the ages of 16 and 29. Most of the cases were mild or moderate.

In response to a Stomp query, a spokesman for Carousell said it does not condone offensive or discriminatory behaviour of any kind. The spokesman said: ""Seller @mbs_hotel was immediately restricted from the marketplace while we conducted investigations. We had also conveyed this restriction to the buyer when they had reached out to us. ""Upon restriction, our content moderation team provided the seller with user education on why their behaviour violated our marketplace community guidelines.

> Families rejoiced after young children ineligible for vaccination were later included for VTL in time for end-of-year holidays.

> Air travellers have been increasingly frustrated by COVID-19 travel restrictions, and quarantine is ""the biggest deterrent"" to air travel, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

> According to a September IATA survey which included Singapore, 84 per cent wouldn't travel if quarantine is required at destination. More than 70 per cent agreed with removing quarantine for those vaccinated or who test negative.

> But Singapore's gradual easing of travel restrictions is by no means a full reopening – generally taken to mean no dedicated lanes, isolation or tests for the fully vaccinated.

> VACCINATED TRAVEL LANES ARE A BABY STEP

> What a stark difference from travel within Europe – which felt like going back to pre-COVID days when I recently travelled there for leisure. Flying from Zurich, Switzerland to Dubrovnik, Croatia, required nothing but my passport and vaccine certificate.

Find a friend who is non judgemental that you can talk to, who will provide a listening ear. It helps to have some release and you may get a better understanding of your own issues.

Don't quit your job without a plan. You may want to consider interviewing and looking at other potential jobs. Secure something first before leaving.

You may also want to think about taking undisturbed leave to help get away from work for a while. Use the leave to try something new and get out of the house.

508,"So far, this is the most sensible reply I have seen in this thread.

Yes, I completely agree. As my all my previous post had try to explain... The issue is not about getting infected (or not). We need to prepare for the eventuality that everyone, at some point (including HCW), will get infected with COVID.

What we need to be concern here is the reproduction rate and the capability of our healthcare infrastructure to deal with the demands. So far, disappointingly, it seems like we are playing catch up with the increased demand.

Despite so much call for ""opening up"" and ""living with covid"", we had not prep our healthcare service well enough to deal with the demand. The government is working now with the ambition to expand healthcare facilities to deal with 5000 daily cases, but I highly doubt that this would be achievable. At about 1.5k to 2k daily cases, the workload for the HCWs is already very punishing. I cannot imagine how it is going to look like if we push towards 5k and beyond.

The reality, and as reflected by the downvotes here, is that we are really not ready to ""live with COVID"" yet. Regardless of what the government, experts and redditors (in r/sg) said, deep down inside we all know that COVID is different and is really not ""just a flu"". 

To live with COVID, is not to underestimate the danger of the virus and downplay the seriousness of the infection. It is understanding the different role that the government and individuals have to play.

Government has a country to run. They will eventually have to restart economic activity and ease more restrictions for the reopening. 

As an individual, we should not see the reopening as a sign that the danger of COVID is over. We should continue to educate ourselves about the virus and take personal responsibility for our own health and well-being. That is to continue maintain good personal hygiene, wear a mask, limit party/gathering sizes (without government mandate), avoid crowded places and continue to maintain social distancing where possible.

As a community, we should keep a close watch and be concern if the rate of infection and hospital admission grew too fast. Not just on the ICU numbers, but also those who are seriously ill as well. The ""serious illness"" numbers can very quickly turn into ICU numbers.",0.0132000000000001,30/9/2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/pxyb2x/ward_closures_in_6_acute_public_hospitals_in/hesot0w/

819,"I understand what you mean. His argument hinges on this: ""it seems like masks alone are insufficient to fully inhibit delta's spread"". 

However, masks were never entirely sufficient to fully inhibit Covid-19 spread, delta or not. It reduces the likelihood of spread, and with delta, a mask is just less effective but it was never presented as a smoking gun. Just because it is no longer as effective, doesn't mean it's entirely ineffective. 

If we take off the most present passive barrier between human to human spread against a more rampant variant in the open when just a small portion of Singaporeans have been exposed to Covid-19, I don't want to imagine how it would become if the situation goes south. 

Remember early last year, when PAP says there is no evidence that masks help; washing hands is good enough? They cannot risk backpedaling the same issue again.

I would argue that, all the more because of this, we should not remove masks for now but ease up more activities as more portion of the population is infected with covid and recover.

While I agree with the other reply about cost tradeoff, I imagine more Singaporeans would welcome easing up activity restrictions earlier than taking off masks.

843,"> # S'pore counsellors face burnout as more people seek therapy amid Covid-19 pandemic

> SINGAPORE - Counsellors in Singapore are facing burnout and high demand amid the Covid-19 pandemic as more individuals seek therapy to cope with mental health concerns and stress related to employment and family relationships.

> Representatives from five firms here said the number of new cases had spiked by an average of 20 per cent from pre-pandemic years, with one firm reporting that its client numbers had tripled between August last year and last month, compared with the corresponding period over 2018 and 2019.

> Mr Tony Ong, senior therapist and manager of counselling services at Counselling and Care Centre, said it had 1,300 more sessions for approximately the same number of clients as in the previous financial year.

> He quoted the example of a client, a single woman living on her own and grieving the loss of her parents before the start of the pandemic. She struggled with isolation and erratic work at the start of the pandemic as well as increasingly frequent mood swings.

> She had difficulties coping with the changes and pressed the counsellor to meet her. The client learnt to cope better after the counsellor increased the frequency of their meetings.

> ""Some of the clients do not feel safe when they have virtual sessions while working from home; that is because of the possible adverse effect it can have on their relationships at home. Further, clients who want to keep their struggles with mental health issues from their family members may be at risk of being discovered,"" Mr Ong said.

> The firms said the issues counsellors face include difficulty finding a private space to speak with clients when conducting virtual sessions, and identifying clients' body language cues, such as twiddling of thumbs and tapping of toes in anxiety, through a screen.

> Care Corner Counselling Centre's principal counsellor Jonathan Siew said that navigating sessions during the pandemic has also taken a toll on counsellors' well-being.

> ""Counsellors, like all Singaporeans, have to cope with ongoing adjustments at home and work, and they are exposed to the same kinds of stressors that have affected almost everyone,"" he said.

> ""Despite such added pressure, they have to ensure that the impact of such distress does not affect their ability and capacity to offer help to clients.""

> Mr Siew said some counsellors have been experiencing distress as they are unable to respond in time to clients whose problems might deteriorate if they do not receive help on time, for instance if clients are undergoing marital conflict which could intensify without timely intervention.

> He said Care Corner has been referring 20 per cent to 30 per cent of its callers to other counselling centres operated by social service agencies.

> To ensure the well-being and emotional stability of counsellors, Care Corner has been conducting regular sessions to check in with the counsellors and supervising their workload.

> The chief well-being officer of the Singapore Counselling Centre, Mr John Lim, said the centre has received more inquiries, not only from individuals but also from organisations asking about employee assistance programmes.

> Mr Lim said there has been a demand for more counsellors to join the firm as a result of the higher volume of cases.

> The centre places a cap on the number of sessions each counsellor can take in a day, and has put in place 30-minute breaks in between sessions for counsellors to rest and prepare for their next session.

> ""Overall, it is important for counsellors to practise self-care and for the agency to ensure that the counsellors' well-being is not compromised by the work arrangement, as the counsellors' emotional stability is the most critical factor influencing the outcome of their work,"" Mr Lim added.

> Counsellor Chua Sze Siong from Mindful Bear, a specialist counselling centre for children, said his colleagues check in on one another and redistribute cases to prevent burnout.

> Mr Chua advised others to plan, prioritise and take time to pause between their tasks.

> He said: ""Work is work, at end of the day we need to de-role to get in touch with our own feelings. I make it a point to change my clothes after my session before making my way home. This is my way of preparing myself physiologically to go home and get out of the counsellor's role.""

As for rules not being broadcasted, as an SMO this is common for a long long time and can be annoying sometimes. 

Long ago when the covid rules first came out, there was actually one that says people are required to wear mask at home as well. Think they already took that down but yeah it was there but not really broadcasted. Another rule for workplace is stated in MOH website, but not on MOM's. Classic case of inconsistency between orgs.

1016,"> # S'pore must press on with strategy of living with Covid-19 and not be paralysed by fear: PM Lee

> SINGAPORE - As Singapore presses on with its strategy of living with Covid-19, an update in mindsets is needed to respect the virus but not be paralysed by fear, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Saturday (Oct 9).

> Addressing the nation on the Covid-19 situation, he set out why a zero-Covid-19 strategy is no longer feasible.

> Instead, people should go about their daily activities as normally as possible, taking necessary precautions and complying with safe management measures. This is because Covid-19 has become a treatable, mild disease for most with vaccinations, he said.

> Acknowledging Singaporeans' anxieties, Mr Lee said many have found it difficult to keep up with new policies and changes to measures. He said he understood their concerns and frustrations.

> ""Some ask: What happened to our plans to build a Covid-19-resilient nation? Has the Government changed its mind? Are we on track to reopening our society?

> ""Yet, others ask: Why are there so many cases? Should we not be fully locking down now?"" he added.

> The Prime Minister said he decided the address the nation to explain Singapore's situation and what has changed, its strategy for this phase of the pandemic and the path forward to a new normal.

> At the start of the outbreak last year, the nation was dealing with an unknown disease and adjusted its strategy as the authorities learned more about the virus, he said.

> ""Our original approach was to do our utmost to prevent Singaporeans from being exposed to Covid-19. We tightened safe management measures (SMM) as much as necessary, to bring cases down to a very low level. We judged this the best way to minimise serious illness and deaths,"" he said, adding that zero-Covid-19 was the right strategy then and helped avert the huge loss of lives that many countries saw.

> ""Our population was not yet vaccinated, people had little or no immunity against Covid-19. The consequences of catching the virus were serious. But because the virus was not so infectious then, our measures could work to break the chain of transmission. The strategy succeeded.""

> But the emergence of the Delta variant has put Singapore in a changed situation, he said. This variant is highly infectious and has spread all over the world, and even with the whole population vaccinated, Singapore will not be able to stamp it out through lockdowns and SMMs.

> Almost every country has accepted this reality, he added.

> ""Furthermore, even if we manage to keep Covid-19 cases down through stringent SMMs, the virus will spread swiftly again as soon as we ease up. This is especially true in Singapore, precisely because of our 'zero Covid' strategy. ""

> Mr Lee pointed out that the majority of Singaporeans have never experienced an infection and are Covid-19-naive. This means their natural immunity is low, and even if they have been vaccinated, they are still at some risk of getting infected.

> This is why Singaporeans must be prepared to see quite many Covid-19 cases for some time to come, he said.

> Yet Singapore cannot stay locked down and closed off indefinitely, he added, as this would be very costly.

> Singaporeans would be unable to resume their lives, participate in social activities, open the borders and revive the economy.

> ""Each time we tighten up, businesses are further disrupted, workers lose jobs, children are deprived of a proper childhood and school life.

> ""Families are separated for even longer, especially families with loved ones overseas, and extended families who have not been able to come together.

> ""All these cause psychological and emotional strain, and mental fatigue for Singaporeans and everyone else here with us, including our migrant workers.""

> He acknowledged that living with Covid-19 has not been a smooth and easy journey.

> When Singapore reached an 80 per cent vaccination rate in August, it eased the heightened alert restrictions with the expectation that cases would go up as more people resumed activities and interacted with one another.

> But the numbers went up more sharply than anticipated because of how infectious the Delta variant was, he said.

> While the healthcare system was initially able to cope, there were worries that it would come under significant strain. It has, and so have medical personnel here, he added.

> ""As total cases grow exponentially, the number of serious cases will also grow in step. And when the number of cases grows very large, even 2 per cent of a very large number will translate to many patients needing hospital and ICU (intensive care unit) beds. Our healthcare system would rapidly be overwhelmed.

> ""That is why last month we tightened up our restrictions. It was to slow down the growth in cases, so that we can ease the burden on our healthcare workers and stabilise our healthcare system.""

> Mr Lee added that the authorities are using this time to further expand healthcare capacity and strengthen its case management, so as to better identify Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms who can recover at home, make sure they can care properly for those who fall seriously, as well as continue to attend to the many non-Covid-19 patients who also have urgent medical needs.

> Singapore is now almost two weeks into the month-long stabilisation phase, which saw tighter restrictions put in place from Sept 27 to Oct 25 to slow the community spread of Covid-19 and buy time for the healthcare system and new protocols, such as the home recovery scheme, to stabilise.

> Dining in and social gatherings were capped once more at two people, and working from home was made the default arrangement.

> The Prime Minister noted that Singapore has one of the lowest Covid-19 death rates in the world - and with Singaporeans' trust and cooperation, also one of the highest vaccination rates at almost 85 per cent of the population.

> This has greatly enhanced Singaporeans' protection against the virus, he said.

> The vast majority of local cases - more than 98 per cent - have mild or no symptoms. Only 2 per cent or less developed more serious illness, and of these, 0.2 per cent - or just two out of every thousand cases - died or needed ICU treatment.

> ""In other words, with vaccination, Covid-19 is no longer a dangerous disease for most of us.""

> He called for a fundamental updating of mindsets. Singaporeans should respect Covid-19, but must not be paralysed by fear, he said.

> ""Let us go about our daily activities as normally as possible, taking necessary precautions and complying with SMMs. With vaccinations, Covid-19 has become a treatable, mild disease for most of us. This is especially if you are young, or even if you are not so young but fully vaccinated.""

It's really disgusting that instead of engaging in a discussion you are behaving like a troll/shill demonizing anyone and anything that you don't like. 

Here's my reply in case you missed it: 

The 85% number of this article is derived by conjecture. Unfortunately it's just wishful thinking. 

Latest literature shows massive reduction in protection after being fully vaccinated:

""Six months after receipt of the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, humoral response was substantially decreased, especially among men, among persons 65 years of age or older, and among persons with immunosuppression.""

Expats under 40 were indeed at the back of the vaccination queue -- just three weeks behind locals under 40.

But what about the part where foreigners over 70 were at the *front* of the queue, alongside locals over 70?

How about the part where foreigners 60 to 69 were second in line, alongside locals 60 to 69?

How about the part where foreigners 45 to 59 were third in line, alongside locals 45 to 59?

Look, Singapore has indeed taken a more nativist turn -- the increased difficulty of hiring EPs is intentional. It's not the heyday of the late 2000s anymore, where any ol' foreigner can get a job here (assuming this nostalgia is even accurate).

But are we really any less a magnet for economic migrants? My guess is if you zoom out, every country in the world is seeing a net decrease in expats because people want to be close to their family during the COVID period.

> SINGAPORE: The occupancy rate for COVID-19 isolation beds in Singapore's hospitals has risen to 85 per cent in October despite efforts to set aside more beds.

> This is up from the 62 per cent occupancy rate in July, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in an update on hospitals' capacity and manpower situation on Friday (Oct 8).

> While community cases have stayed around the 3,000 mark in recent days, the time period for infections to double has slowed from six to eight days three weeks ago, to about 10 to 12 days now, said the ministry.

> Nonetheless, the large daily caseload has placed ""significant strain"" on Singapore's healthcare system, it said.

> ""A key resource constraint we now face is our healthcare manpower,"" said MOH.

> Public healthcare institutions and private healthcare providers have redeployed staff and recruited additional short-term manpower to ramp up beds, it said.

> ""We are also bringing in more manpower by reaching out to individuals registered with the Singapore Healthcare Corps, including both healthcare professionals and laypersons,"" said MOH.

> ""We have also approached nurses who are registered with the Singapore Nursing Board but who are currently not in active practice.""

> About 900 people have stepped forward and are being referred to suitable roles in public hospitals, including possible deployments to the COVID-19 treatment facilities, said the ministry.

> Those interested in signing up to help can do so online, added MOH.

> Ho Ching, Chief Executive Officer of Temasek Holdings, urged the public in a Facebook post on Sep. 7 to slow down their social gatherings, especially in settings where masks are not worn.

> Limit social gatherings

> Ho's post came after the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced a restriction of social gathering and interactions at workplaces on Sep. 6.

> The new restriction kicks in today, Sep. 8.

> Ho expanded on her point in a later Facebook post on Sep. 7, where she specified that social gatherings should be limited to a maximum of two per week.

> She added: ""Just tahan (Bahasa for endure) for another two to four weeks.""

> This, according to Ho, is part of a ""tango"" of loosening and tightening measures to seek the right balance between the measures in place, and the number of Covid-19 cases within the community.

> Ho: Three to four weeks to see impact

> While there are hidden cases infected with Covid-19 within the community, Ho said the number of Covid-19 community cases will not go up immediately.

> She equated this to a ""laggy system"", where the effects will only be seen after some time.

> In light of this, Ho said that the number of Covid-19 community cases will only increase one to two weeks later.

> This is because of silent carriers, who unknowingly transfer the virus to others, within the community.

> This, coupled with the Delta variant, speeds up the rate of transmissions within the community.

> As such, Ho said that it would take between 13 to 14 days before the trend of community cases reflect the measures in response to curb the spread of Covid-19.

> This is the same restriction that MOH has encouraged all individuals to reduce their non-essential social activities at a media doorstop on Sep. 6.

> Ho went on and said that the measure of Covid-19's local impact includes the number of people with severe illnesses that require oxygen support in Intensive Care Units (ICU).

> As Covid-19 becomes endemic, the focus will be shifting away from the number of daily Covid-19 cases and towards the number of cases in ICU instead.

1492,"Indeed there are studies reporting that some variants, Delta included, show some resistance against the vaccine. Governments and research institutes worldwide have reported a reduction in efficacy from 95% to 70-80% against Delta, and our MOH's latest results show a 69% in Singapore. This is still a highly effective vaccine, way more than the 40-50% expected of your annual flu jab. Furthermore, we are seeing 90% reduction of severe illness among the few breakthrough infections. 0.2% of our fully vaccinated patients in the past month had required intensive care, while nearly 2% of unvaccinated patients have been admitted to ICU or died. We cannot downplay the importance of the vaccination programme in keeping our people and community safe.

Just like the flu virus, COVID will mutate. This is simply nature taking its course. However, we can combat COVID in the same way through annual booster shots and further advances in medical technology. Pfizer is already developing a booster specifically targeted against Delta, and I bet other pharma companies have been doing so. Perhaps we might even see hybrid vaccines being produced, allowing you to be protected from the flu and COVID with a single shot. The most important thing now is to ensure everyone gets their first 2 doses so the population has some baseline protection; after that has been achieved, boosters will provide continuous protection in the long term.",0.03420000000000001,8/8/2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ozvyrt/80yearold_sporean_woman_dies_from_covid19/h8441wk/

Huh? 60-69 years old have 89% who took the first dose, 84% who took the 2nd shot. 12-39 year old are 85% and 82% respectively. That 4% is negligible considering the 4 months lead time that boomers have. 

Considering that about 1/4-1/3 of this group are only allowed to take Pfizer and not Moderna, that's huge. Also, 12-17 year olds likely have to get parental consent before taking the jab. Who knows if the 10%+ of unvaccinated parents have something to do with it

> SINGAPORE: Sofi Sui, owner of the Italian restaurant Pasta Brava has, by her estimate, lost S$1 million over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.

> The latest restrictions - a return to Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), which again prohibits people from dining in - means she will have to dip into her reserves once more, she told CNA.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""For sure it's going to affect (businesses) because, especially for myself, I have been coming out with my own personal savings,"" said Ms Sui, adding that this is despite help from the Government.

> The restrictions will last till Aug 18. Ms Sui, who is also a chef, said that she has ""no heart"" to wind up her restaurant.

> 

> ""If I lost S$1 million, from a business point of view, I have to cut already, but the point now is that I basically just don't have the heart to,"" she said.

> ""I can't stop now. Why? Because I (have) already lost so much.""

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Her main concerns are the commitment she has made to more than 20 employees who work at the restaurant and another cafe she owns, and the S$400,000 she has invested in the outlet that Pasta Brava will be moving to, she said.

> ""This time, maybe I will have to lose another S$200,000? S$100,000? For me, my focus is always that I don't have the heart to let go of my staff,"" said Ms Sui.

> She likened shutting down her business to divorce.

> Advertisement

> ""There's a relationship to it. You cannot just divorce a business. You divorce a spouse, it's just one single human being … but the thing is that when it's a business, it's a whole entire team,"" she said.

> 

> HANGING ON

> Co-founder of Moonstone bar Jeremy Lim echoed the sentiment, that F&B is a passion-led business.

> For three months running, the bar has been bleeding losses. To keep it afloat, Mr Lim and fellow shareholders are trying to raise capital to ensure cash flow for the next one to two months.

> Failing which, they will have to take a loan, their second since the pandemic began.

> ""That's not a good situation,"" Mr Lim said, describing it as being in a ""state of languish"".

> ""We don't really know what to look forward to. We know we are going to work hard just so that we can pay all our staff and our rent and we take nothing out of it.""

> 

> BUSINESS IS LIKE A ""BABY""

> While the latest curbs on dining in have dealt a direct blow to the F&B industry, retail businesses are not spared either.

> At zero-waste store Unpackt, co-founder Florence Tay lamented that the street that her store is on was ""empty"" on Thursday. She had been open for four hours and in that time, saw just one walk-in customer.

> 

> Having already closed one outlet, Ms Tay said that the latest round of restrictions has added to the strain. ""Our income is quite volatile. We are just barely scraping through.""

> She and another co-founder are in a ""no-pay"" situation, she said.

> And because her business is classified as a supermarket, it falls outside the remit of certain government support schemes.

> While Unpackt sells food and other items that are free of packaging, the core of the business is educating people on environmentally friendly practices, holding farmers' markets that showcase items made by small outfits and supplying office pantries, she said.

> Shops in VivoCity, a mall at Harbourfront, on May 17, 2021. (Photo: Schmike Chong)

> Despite the struggle, and discussions on whether they should cut their losses, the founders continue to pump in their own savings.

> ""The business, for us, is like a baby. You take so much time and effort to nurture the child, and then after that suddenly you say kill the child,"" she said.

> But even as footfall slows to a trickle, one family-run business said it is readjusting to the conditions.

> Fashion One, which has several outlets, is surviving for now, but only because the owner is drawing on his reserves, said general manager Nazreen Sharief.

> The main consideration for keeping the business alive is the welfare of its long-serving employees, many of whom are getting on in age, as well as loans that need to be serviced, Ms Nazreen said.

> While the return of restrictions has hurt, it has also provided a playbook.

> ""We learn and we adapt. We manage our expectations and our sales targets based on what happened in the past,"" she said.

> ""This time, it's a bit easier because it's the same scenario that happened the last time, so we can use that as a template.""

1788,"This is the kind of shitty planning and pussyfooting you'd expect from a secondary school student planned camp, not from a multi-ministry task force spearheaded by the country's leaders-in-waiting.

I would like to believe that between an authoritative style of governance, a highly educated populace and a world class medical infrastructure, Singapore should be poised to tackle a pandemic effectively. And yet somehow for every success that we've had theres 2 or 3 colossal failures in how we've handled covid.

Theres no exit plan or roadmap to incentivise vaccine take up, constant pandering to a subset of the population that have been vaccine resistant, and the most ridiculous oversights possible (overly lax immigration control, KTV/nightlife situation that has literally just played out in taiwan). The worst part is the continual punishment of the large portion of the populace that have been accommodating and accepting of covid measures and an refusal to use neither carrot or stick to boost vaccination take up rates amongst the unwilling (those that are unable to due to medical reasons are obviously not within this group). And i find it ridiculous that the government does not realise our recent return to HA just sends a confirmation to the vaccine hesitant that there is absolutely no reason to get vaccinated (vaccinated or not, you still get fked so whats the point).

At the end of the day, what we have are a bunch of very capable administrators that are absolutely unsuited to leading/navigating a country through a crisis. There are no leaders in this ""4G"" of ours, they are lacking in charisma, foresight, communication skills and a dozen other adjectives. I fully agree that no human is perfect, but the whole point of a government/taskforce is to reduce potential oversight and flaws in the individual by complimenting it with the strength of others.

LOL. This is very typical of what people like you do when they've run out of valid arguments and still insist they are right - engage in **personal attacks and insults**.

>the focus of my original comment is more about the reopening/going back to normal plans rather than how they're actually handling the clusters.

Yes, it is obvious that - to your mind - re-opening has *absolutely nothing* to do with how clusters are formed and handled. So does it then follow that regardless of how big the KTV + Port clusters get, you'd advocate for ""keep calm and carry on"" with re-opening as originally planned? Would you say that also regardless of how many more new clusters form in the future? For the sake of ""predictability""?

Those factors have nothing to do with determining whether COVID-19 *is* \- in your words - ""obviously endemic"". Your statement is not that it ""will eventually be"" endemic but you said that it is *already* ""obviously endemic"". And even when you made an unequivocal statement to the latter effect, you failed to cite even a *single* factor that is determinative of that issue.

>This was back in May 2020 when there is much less variants, data, not even vaccines, much lesser spread of COVID. Its becoming very clear that it'll be endemic now.

Yeah, the article *you chose* to cite in support of your opinion that it is ""obviously endemic"" now was from May 2020. It's good that you recognise how that article is pretty poor evidence for your claim.

>I already explained to you the meaning of ""making things up"", a point that you clearly conceded

I did not concede that at all. Check my previous comments.

>Pretty sure I did when I said ""To start, having some sort of reopening plan (% of vaccinations),""

You said that *after* I pointed out to you that you conveniently ignored the vaccination programme when you falsely accused the Gov of ""making things up"".

>A very educated guess will tell me that vaccine effectiveness in other countries + our own, as well as the hospitalization rates (of which the vast majority are unvaccinated in places like the US).

""A very educated guess"" requires data and evidence. Where is yours? I see none here.

>There are almost certainly mathematical models to predict this sort of thing, but instead the ""5 weeks thing"" is just taking a fixed integer (of which there was no basis) and then multiplying by a factor within a time period. …  
>  
>As a member of the public unpaid by the government I'll just offer my feedback, whether they take it or not its not up to me.

I'll wait for you to share your evidence of where the government is ""just taking a fixed integer (of which there was no basis)"". You've just proven that you are, again, simply accusing the Gov of ""making things up"". It's one thing to be offering feedback, it's something else to say the Gov was ""making things up""

>But obviously the difference is with our standards of 'high', not the actual figures despite your weak attempt to discredit me. 70% is reasonably high

If you look at the article I referred to, several experts disagree with you. If you think their arguments are ""weak"", I'd suggest you bring the data you have and take it up with them. Some quotes:

>""But if 20 per cent of the elderly decide not to be vaccinated, then that is the group in which the deaths will dominate when Covid-19 spreads in the community.  — Associate Professor Alex Cook, vice-dean of research at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore  
>  
>Associate Professor Lim Poh Lian, director of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases' high-level isolation unit: ""Making vaccination as accessible as possible is needed to close the last mile gap for this group \[- i.e. 70 and above\].""  
>  
>Finance Minister Lawrence Wong said on Facebook that vaccination rates for those aged 70 and above were not high enough.

Also, you're shifting goalposts when you say,

>its absurd to have endless restrictions thanks to a few % of the population who don't want to be vaccinated.

We are not talking about just a few percent of people who don't want to be vaccinated. We are talking about the most vulnerable and at risk being under-vaccinated compared to the rest of the population. Look at the demographics of people who've died in Singapore, apart from those with pre-existing conditions, it is the seniors who are dying from COVID-19 and it's the seniors who are not getting vaccinated at as high a rate as is required, according to several experts.

Apparently, according to you, these experts have made ""weak"" arguments.

Cases have indeed risen to around 25k daily, over 10x more than the minimum in May. However, active hospitalizations have barely risen by 2x to around 2000, and the daily deaths is currently stable in the 10-20 range. In comparison, when the UK last hit 25k daily cases last December, there were over 20k active hospitalizations and 500 daily deaths. Analysis into vaccine effectiveness also support our observations, with the UK reporting 96% protection against severe symptoms in the Delta variant, up from the 93% against the Alpha variant. It's clear that this disease has been diminished to a threat no more than the seasonal flu, and as vaccination rates rise, the situation will only get better.

This isn't saying that Singapore should follow with a similar aggressive reopening plan. Our government has always prioritized minimizing risk, and this undoubtedly saved hundreds, if not thousands of lives last year.

Since there's a weaker antibody response against the Delta variant, this means that Moderna's efficacy against Delta variant will probably be lower compared to the original variant. In any case, this is just a study of only 8 patients so I wouldn't be too quick to draw any conclusions from it.

2622,"> # Singapore facing increasing likelihood of 'exponential rise' in COVID-19 cases, quick action needed: MOH

> SINGAPORE: Singapore needs to ""take quick action"" to dampen the increasing likelihood of an ""exponential rise"" in COVID-19 cases, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Sep 6).

> Speaking to reporters, Mr Lawrence Wong, co-chair of the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force, said the transmission rate of COVID-19 has to be slowed down, and Singapore will ""attempt to do so"" without going into another phase of heightened alert.

> ""What is of concern to us is not just the absolute number of cases, but the rate at which the virus is spreading. And that's the reproduction rate, or R.

> ""Currently, the R is more than one. Cases are doubling every week. And if we continue on this trajectory of infection, it means we could have 1,000 cases in two weeks, or possibly 2,000 cases in a month.""

> From the experience of other countries, when cases rise ""so sharply"" there will be many more cases in the ICU and more people succumbing to the virus, said Mr Wong, who is also the Finance Minister.

> ""It's not just the unvaccinated seniors. Because even for vaccinated persons, there will be a small proportion of them falling severely ill, and if you have a very high infection caseload, the small proportion will translate to a sizable number of ICU cases and eventually fatalities,"" he added.

> ""So we have to slow down the transmission rate and bring R down. We will attempt to do so without going back to another heightened alert. And in particular, we will go for aggressive contact tracing and ringfencing of cases and clusters, and push for more pervasive testing.""

> The number of new COVID-19 cases in the community has almost doubled to more than 1,200 in the past week, up from about 600 in the week before, said MOH in a separate press release.

> Unvaccinated people are still susceptible to severe illness and death from COVID-19. Over the last 28 days, 6.7 per cent of unvaccinated cases fell severely ill or died, MOH noted.

> ""If the infection continues at this trajectory, we will see a doubling of cases every week. This means that we can expect to see more individuals suffer serious consequences due to COVID-19 infection,"" the ministry said.

> ""We need to take quick action now to dampen the increasing likelihood of an exponential increase in cases. This will also buy us time to get more people, in particular seniors, vaccinated as soon as possible, and also to roll out our booster programme to those aged 60 and above.""

> MORE FREQUENT ROUTINE TESTS

> The frequency of the mandatory fast and easy test rostered routine testing regime will be stepped up from once every two weeks to once a week from next Monday, said Mr Wong.

> The enhanced frequency will allow cases to be detected and ringfenced more quickly, said MOH in the press release.

> ""This is particularly important given the infectiousness of the Delta variant, as observed locally where there have been shorter periods between each generation of infection,"" it said.

> The regime is currently in place for higher-risk settings like F&B, personal care services and gym and fitness studios.

> It will be extended to more settings with ""frequent community interactions"", said MOH in the press release. This includes workers in retail, malls, supermarkets as well as delivery personnel and transport workers, said Mr Wong.

> These tests will continue to be administered primarily through the Employer Supervised SelfSwab. The Government will subsidise the costs of all tests under this enhanced surveillance regime for both vaccinated and unvaccinated people until the end of 2021, said MOH in the press release.

> Regular testing for employees working onsite beyond these settings will also be stepped up, said Mr Wong.

> The multi-ministry task force will distribute antigen rapid test kits to all companies so that they can administer weekly tests for their staff over the next two months, he added.

> Each company will receive eight kits per employee for weekly testing of their staff over a two-month period, said MOH in the press release.

> All companies are expected to initiate weekly testing for their onsite staff, and the tests can be administered by the individuals by themselves at home or at the work premises, the press release read.

> Employers should put in place a process to ensure that the tests are done properly and report the results to the respective Government agencies, said MOH.

> ""We hope that the distribution of ART kits to both households and companies will help to instil a culture of responsibility in administering regular self-tests. This will become an important tool in the new normal, so that we can dampen the impact of COVID-19 without having to impose heightened alerts,"" the press release read.

> PUBLIC HEALTH ALERTS

> The Government will also be sending out health risk warnings and health risk alerts to people when a cluster of cases is identified, on top of quarantining close contacts, said MOH in the press release.

> This will ""cast a wide net"" around the cases and contain the clusters quickly, the press release read.

> ""With more cases circulating in the community, there will also be more people being issued such HRWs (health risk warnings) or HRAs (health risk alerts).""

> These are not quarantine alerts, MOH said.

> But individuals who receive a health risk warning will be required by law to get a polymerase chain reaction test and self-isolate until they receive a negative result from their first test, the ministry said in the press release.

> After that, they will need to continue to take antigen rapid tests, and then another PCR test on the 14th day, said MOH.

> People who receive a health risk alert are not subject to the same measures, but are ""strongly encouraged"" to go for a PCR test as soon as possible. Individuals who receive either alerts should also reduce their social interactions for 14 days, the press release read.

2726,"To be fair, we are not in a hurry to gobble down all the vaccines that are on offer in the world, given our relatively low infection rate. 

It makes sense for countries like UK and US, which are the most affected, to acquire vaccines as fast as possible to curb the spread. 

However, like SK, which has so far also managed the contain the virus spread, I see no need for Singapore to be throwing money at Pfizer and Modena to skip the queue. 

In general, Asian countries like SK and Japan that have managed to keep numbers low are not hurrying to throw money to buy the vaccine, so it would be disingenuous to complain about SG while not keeping in mind the global context:

Even after CB was lifted and we went into Phase 2, Phase 3... I never really left the shell I went into once CB was announced. I still went out with friends (in groups of 5 or 8 depending on how many pax the restrictions allowed), but mostly, I still stick to myself at home most of the time.

I also realised over the past weekend that after P2HA was announced... I've almost lived an online life. Our morning is night time for Americans, 12pm is lunch time, then after that Europeans wake up. Because of restrictions for going out physically, I've 'withdrawn' into living a life on Twitch/Discord. I'm almost afraid that IF covid goes away tomorrow, this lifestyle will be too comfortable to move away from.

Just wanna be clear that this is just something mild, but speaking from personal experience why CB isn't desirable (for me), and no CB means I could try and fight out of this 'rut' I'm in once more restrictions are lifted.",-0.008700000000000041,31/5/2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/nolpgq/rsingapore_random_discussion_and_small_questions/h021go5/

> All other travellers departing from Australia who have been in Australia (excluding Victoria state) in the last 21 days prior to travel will continue to be subject to a COVID-19 test upon arrival at the airport, in lieu of their stay-home notice.

2899,"Yeah I can definitely agree with you that the lack of information or a clear narrative about the vaccine is preventing people from proactively becoming vaccinated of their own accord. 

Yeah, you are right; I wasn't sure between SinoVac and SinoPharm, Phase 3 trials have concluded since December 2020 when authorized for emergency distribution, and Moderna and Pfizer have seen participation of 30,000+ and 40,000+, both 1:1, with both showing, of a comparison between the control group and vaccinated group, about a 95% efficacy in preventing severe COVID symptoms (data is about only preventing symptoms, which is the primary endpoint of the vaccines, but that still does not and cannot discuss of any long term implications from taking the vaccines, i.e., ""unknown side effects""; also sample sizes of 30,000+/40,000+ are, as you also suggest, not sufficiently representative of the population); thank you for clarifying, I was mistaken on those counts.  

And yeah, ""10 times"", but this ""10 times"" cerebral blood clot thing, the correlation is not that strong, e.g., it's not the same 513,000+ people getting tested, but 2 separate groups, or maybe cerebral blood clots may form after 2 weeks in those vaccinated (it's only a snapshot of 2 weeks later). But admittedly there is a correlation nonetheless as far as the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are concerned. 

Hmm...if the professor weren't him, an active member of the legislature and executive branches of government, then yeah, maybe; but doctors who had made themselves legally liable in making representations that could cost them more than just their medical licenses...hmmm; I guess they had concerns and they shared those concerns especially since the purpose of emergency use authorizations in both Moderna and Pifzer are respectively for immunization of persons 18 years old and above, and 16 years old and above, so children weren't included; funny how the ""professor"" did not provide an opinion about children (I didn't read the original letter) and the vaccine. As always, better to be prudent than see dead or disabled children; in some cases anyways.

Decided to focus more on the people who I care around me and have a shoulder to lean on, only to face more pressures from others. Just broke up earlier this week, and the feeling of being let-down by so much really sinks.

Decided to use my free time picking up business and economics and accounting courses (Bloomberg Markets Concepts etc.) and learning its fundamentals to better support my degree I and studying for. I never knew I will return to this which I have avoided for years saying I don't have an edge in understanding money.

Having plans to invest small amounts of money here and there only to see more covid and other uncertainty surrounding the markets, which is a good learning opportunity but a daunting one.

Made do with zoom meetings with distant friends while falling into the discord rabbit hole. Might just visit my old hobbies such as music, piano and mineralogy.

Now I'm just chilling at home, doing chores, shouting at my siblings over dumb arguments and jokes. Got recently addicted into crypto, mostly blockchain gaming (it's not gambling unlike what most think they are), and its paying off.

Overall, I'm just grateful with the already sheltered life I have and the people around me. Taking a breather from all the stress and insane expectations I put on myself.

It is not known whether the Indian mission in Singapore had pushed back against the Singapore Ministry of Health terming the strain as an Indian variant.  
Almost the entire western media has termed B.1.617.2 as an ""Indian strain"" though the political leadership such as the UK Health Minister Matt Hancock or US Secretary of State Joe Biden has never linked this variant to India.

3058,"Fwiw I agree that a ""zero COVID"" strategy is unrealistic. He's right, our healthcare system is literally there to deal with the community cases. My personal concern lies more in the fact that 1) somehow we ended up letting a whole bunch of the more infectious B1617(?)/Indian variant cases through, which could in time overwhelm said healthcare system, and/or 2) that our vaccination rates simply aren't high enough for us to afford that kind of mistake.

Rightly or wrongly, this feels like a three-dimensional issue to me: vaccination rates, community spread, and imported cases. As long as at least two of the three are in good shape, our healthcare system can cope. But with our vaccination rates being just ok (as compared to US/UK/Israel), we can't afford significant community spread and/or large numbers of inbound travel (ie the risk of imported cases).

Our country is one where almost everything is dictated by the government not the free market, a nanny state. Thats why there is cronyism in almost all of the bigger listed companies in Singapore.

Unlike US where they can vote for head of state, we cannot. So to serve this function and keep the system up, they cannot apologise, cannot use strong words against anything other than on Singaporeans (Singaporeans commit more crime than foreigners + current covid situation is by South Asian Variant, not Indian variant, etc), they also cannot be seen going against each other (got party whip), and also the reserved election.

In comparison with variants coming in from India, the Govt decided to prioritise our construction industry and took a very long time in taking other covid-19 variants seriously. It seems like their efforts to boost the economy has instead, backfired.

Couldn't agree more. Covid is survivable to many and to continue on such a careful path itself could be reckless. I hope people are visiting their Doctors for all regular issues that can also cause deaths to go up  

For example, most of the backlog created in the UK's NHS was due to pausing most regular checks and many people afraid to go due to the Virus.

Now that Singapore has a vaccination rate of around 80% (highest possible efficacy) then it should begin to realise the reality that covid is here to stay. 

The country has the resourses to help protect those it continues to deem vulnerable. It has a duty to everyone else.

> Employers should allow employees to work from home if they are able to do so, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) today (Apr. 30).

> Employers were also advised to:

> Continue to stagger start times of employees who need to return to the workplace, and implement flexible working hours.

> Avoid social gatherings at the workplace

> These measures help lower transmission risks by reducing interactions at the workplace and in public places, including public transport, said MOH.

> MOH also said that public agencies working in the Novena area such as the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) will be asking their staff to work from home where possible.

> These announcements were made in light of a recent spike in community cases in the last few days, with the majority of them being linked to two new clusters announced on Apr. 29.

> MOH also advised continued vigilance, so as to ""avoid an uncontrolled resurgence of community cases"".

> It also advised members of the public to observe the following:

> Avoid going to crowded places, and stay home where possible. Limit social gatherings to two per day in total, whether it is with another household or in a public place. Keep groups as small as possible. Stick to a regular group of contacts. Stay home when unwell, see a doctor to get tested when sick, and be vaccinated when it is offered to you.

> ""Our recent community cases show that the risks of a Covid-19 outbreak remains high, even as we press ahead with vaccination,"" said MOH, adding that enforcement efforts would be stepped up.

> ""We will continue to review the current suite of measures and will take further steps to tighten and significantly reduce the level of interactions in the community should transmission persist,"" said MOH.

> Work-from-home not the norm from Apr. 5, 2021

> The most recent update on Covid-19 measures in the workplace took effect on Apr. 5, 2021, when work-from-home was replaced by a hybrid working arrangement.

> The following restrictions were relaxed from Apr. 5:

> Up to 75 per cent of the employees who are able to work from home can be at the workplace at any one time, up from the previous 50 per cent.

> The previous cap on the time an employee spends at the workplace was lifted.

> Split team arrangements were no longer mandatory, although companies may continue to adopt such arrangements if they wish.

> After this was announced, public servants were encouraged to return to the office on three days each week.

3513,"SINGAPORE: A 45-year-old man who was his mother's caregiver at a COVID-19 quarantine facility was among the five new community cases reported in Singapore on Saturday (Apr 24).  

The Singapore permanent resident had completed his COVID-19 vaccination, having received his second dose more than a month ago on Mar 19.

""The COVID-19 vaccine is effective in preventing symptomatic disease for the vast majority of those vaccinated, but it is possible for vaccinated individuals to get infected,"" said the Ministry of Health (MOH).

The man, identified as Case 62373 is a senior executive at Wirana Shipping Corporation.

His parents arrived in Singapore from India on Apr 15.

His father tested positive on his arrival swab and was taken to hospital.

His mother was identified as a close contact of two COVID-19 cases on the same flight and was placed on quarantine from Apr 16 to 30 at a government facility.

The two cases - 62029 and 62030 - are dependent's pass holders whose infections were confirmed on Apr 16. They are a 41-year-old British woman and a 36-year-old Indian national respectively.

""While Case 62373 had not travelled to India with his parents, he had requested to take care of his mother at the quarantine facility, and moved into the same room as her on Apr 16, where he had remained,"" MOH said.

The man developed a blocked nose on Apr 23 and reported it. He was taken to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Apr 24 and his infection was confirmed that day. 

His serological test has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection.

Stayed two nights in hostels and two nights in AirBnbs; as a guy, I felt like hostels aren't actually that different from staying in camp during NS, just guard your belongings properly. English is widely present in Estonia so language wasn't much of an issue, and I could just use google translate for the rest. Also visited Narva on the Russian border, where I really got the abandoned Soviet town feel, and also got a lot of second glances from locals (who is this Asian and what's he doing here?).

I liked the freedom to go wherever I wanted to, without being bound to others' agendas and desires. Eat whatever I want, walk wherever I want, see whatever I want, and so on.

I recently ordered some pizza using GrabFood (Little Caesars to be precise). Ordered two pies, requested for them to be left outside my doorstep since I was in a Zoom Call. When I opened my door, it was four pies instead. I tried to contact the driver but his details cannot be found once the delivery was made. Tried searching delivery history but I can't find his details anymore. Waited for 20 minutes to see if the driver would come back in case he was making multiple deliveries from the same outlet.

After 20 minutes, I said f\*\*\* it and just ate the pizzas and freeze the rest of it for dinner/the next day.

I just want to know who is liable for this fumble, so I won't feel guilty for eating it.P.S. I thought of giving it to my neighbors, but we aren't that close and they might feel unsafe because of covid anyways

edit: I hate wasting food... Now I have to eat them for the rest of the week, which I already feel sick after having two pies split amongst me and my other family members

So for example, if you have contracted COVID 19 (touch wood), contact tracers do not know where you been to.

You could say you might remember yesterday events very well, but contact tracers can need data more than 2 weeks beforehand to trace your routes. I bet you can't remember what you had for lunch 6 days ago. This extra time digging deeper could be critical in preventing the spread of chain community infections or stopping a super spreader event.

BEIJING: China has begun using anal swabs to test those it considers at high risk of contracting COVID-19, state TV reported, with social media users and travellers squirming over the invasive procedure which doctors say can be more effective in detecting the virus.

Officials took anal swabs from residents of neighbourhoods with confirmed COVID-19 cases in Beijing last week, broadcaster CCTV said, while those in designated quarantine facilities have also undergone the test.

Small, localised outbreaks in recent weeks have seen multiple cities in northern China sealed off from the rest of the country and prompted mass testing campaigns - which up until now have mostly been conducted using throat and nose swabs.

But the anal swabs method ""can increase the detection rate of infected people"" as traces of the virus linger longer in the anus than in the respiratory tract, Li Tongzeng, a senior doctor from Beijing's You'an Hospital, told CCTV.",-0.012400000000000022,28/1/2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/l6ohhg/this_deal_is_getting_worse_all_the_time/gl1v46k/

So if I'm reading this right, Pfizer used a visual check to obtain their supposed 52.4% efficacy rating while the other study used actual lab tests to verify?

Can I interpret it as the Pfizer vaccine could be even more effective at preventing COVID-19 symptoms (more than the 52%)?

Precovid people work with flu or fever because there's work to be done and you can only do in office.

But now post covid, you are advised not to work in office if you have flu or fever to prevent spreading to other people.

But because of Covid, doctors also automatically you get 5 day MC. 

The issue here is - do you take the doctor instruction to rest 5 days at home!? Or do you take the 5 days to WORK FROM HOME instead of giving office? Because the 5 days MC is now like an automatic directive given by MOH. Don't think any doctors will risk to give lesser than 5 days.

Yes we don't know. We don't know the vaccines are 100% safe long term either. It's a judgement call balancing between the risks and the cost of having no plan/locking down forever.

>	• We went from 8 serious cases to 40 in just a week's time, with the recent case load, this looks like it's about to get worse. Let's see how this develops over the next week.

Not knowing the future does not preclude you from making contingent plans. I don't know if I'll be hit by a truck tomorrow. But I do have a rough idea of the plans for ""hit by truck"" versus ""not hit by truck""

>• A roadmap is problematic because then it's going to become an expectation and the MMTF will lose some of their agility and flexibility on decision making. If they then have to make adjustments for our safety, they'll be unfairly criticised, so I think not giving out clear timelines makes sense for now.

My expectation is for them to make well-considered plans with different paths for different foreseeable prameters. For example, when they announced the NDP milestone in June, did they not consider even the possibility that a big cluster may emerge, and if so that such plans should be off the table? (Btw, rah rah optimism is not planning. It's wishful thinking.)

>• Why do I say for now? Because we are still waiting for about a million people to get their 2nd shots (+ 2 weeks to take effect). I don't think we can think about roadmaps before we hit that milestone and then see what the data tells us (about serious cases, deaths, etc.)

4586,"> at the shit state of India during this pandemic

They've handled the pandemic far better than expected for a corruption-wracked country with a laundry list of shortcomings. The United States' reported COVID caseload is currently about to hit 20m, more than twice that of India's current 10m. In mid-2020 the Straits Times' ""reporters"" were saying that India's caseload would shoot past America's by the third quarter of this year, yet that never actually happened. 

India's political and infrastructural limitations means there is some underreporting to account for in the official tally, but that is true for every country (including Singapore because of our dorm situation and China because aggressive CCP censorship). But otherwise testing is widespread (second only to America, but not accounting for China because no news comes out of the country), Indian citizens are by and large compliant enough to accept mask-wearing (if not social distancing) as part of their everyday normal because the whole ""individual rights"" American shtick doesn't fly there and they defer to authority, and perhaps the most important factor: it is a democratic country with a rambunctious free press that always blurts and blabs about the latest sexual assault and political crisis, so any hint of COVID fudging on the state's part will have the press turning it into a screamfest, picking up the slack, and filling in the gaps.

10 million cases is still a lot, but when viewed as a percentage of a whole, the mitigation has been fairly decent for a large country with extreme limitations. It's not fair to turn this into a pissing contest against them when they have done their best to stem the suffering from a virus they didn't even create.",0.005899999999999794,30/12/2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/kmfr4s/shanmugam_disses_us_response_to_covid_praises/ghg99lv/

> All the new cases were imported and were placed on stay-home notice or isolated upon arrival in Singapore. Thirteen of the cases are returning Singaporeans or permanent residents, MOH added.

> NEW SCHEME TO HELP LOWER- TO MIDDLE-INCOME WORKERS

> A new scheme to help Singaporeans and permanent residents affected by the COVID-19 pandemic will be launched in January, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) said on Wednesday.

> The COVID-19 Recovery Grant will focus on lower- to middle-income workers and self-employed people.

> Advertisement

> MSF said there are ""individuals who remain significantly affected by job or income loss"" despite the previous Budget relief measures and various National Jobs Council initiatives.

> ""The Government has therefore decided to provide targeted support to help these individuals while they actively search for a new job or training opportunities,"" said the ministry.

> Under the scheme, eligible Singaporeans and permanent residents aged 21 years old and above will receive up to S$700 a month for three months.

> This will be for employees who have been retrenched or had their contract terminated, or placed on no-pay leave for at least three consecutive months.

> Those who are facing salary loss of at least 50 per cent on average for at least three consecutive months will receive up to S$500 for three months.

> Self-employed people facing an average loss in net trade income of at least 50 per cent over a period of at least three consecutive months, compared to their average monthly net trade income in 2019 or 2020, will also be eligible to receive up to S$500 for three months.

> The job loss, involuntary no-pay leave or income loss should have occurred after Jan 23 this year - when the first COVID-19 case was detected in Singapore - and must still be present at the point of application.

> 

> Applications for the grant will be open from Jan 18 to Dec 31 next year.

> Lower-income groups and the issue of inequality will get special attention from the Government as it helps companies and workers through the Covid-19 crisis, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.

> Speaking at the People's Action Party (PAP) biennial conference, PM Lee said a major worry about the pandemic is it could hurt lower-income families disproportionately and undo years of progress made to level up low-wage workers.

> This cannot be done through ""glib slogans or half-baked proposals"", he said, but with a full range of practical support measures.

> Yesterday, he cited the Progressive Wage Model, Workfare and Silver Support, and said the Government will develop new ways to help lower-income groups.

> PM Lee also acknowledged the worry Singaporeans have about competition from foreign work pass holders and said he fully understood the pressures.

> Singaporean workers must feel reassured that the Government will help them hold their own against foreign competition, and that they are fairly treated, he said. Failing to do so will lead to a lot of ""angst and social tension"". But the Government must also convince Singaporeans that the best way to protect livelihoods and families is to keep Singapore open for talent and business, he added.

> PM Lee cautioned: ""If we just close ourselves up and send away the work pass holders, it will result in fewer jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans, and more hardship for our workers and their families.""

> He also noted that the pandemic is as much a political problem as it is a public health problem.

> Reopening the economy and relaxing Covid-19 restrictions is a delicate balancing act, he noted, pointing to how many countries had tried but failed to get the balance right and seen infections rise again.

> Those countries had to lock down once more. But by then, people had become tired and cynical about the restrictions, causing them to turn against their governments and blame leaders for bad outcomes.

> This illustrates how it takes political leadership to convince people of the need to keep safety measures in place, especially when case numbers are low.

> ""We must show people while we do all these things that we care for them, and we empathise with their difficulties.""

> He added: ""And we must maintain public trust in the Government and its leaders.

> ""So that if we have to implement new measures or policies, people will accept them, cooperate with them, and give them a chance to work. Otherwise, it will be very difficult for us to survive this crisis without further mishap.""

Let's be real, the next in line PM that can't read off a script, how to have faith he will be able to perform as a PM when part of the job is to engage other world leaders where things are never always following a script.

GRC system, carve out Marymount SMC. Moving JoTeo from Marymount SMC and shielding her from a good chance at defeat. Letting her get carried by other MP.

Talking about character but Tan Wu Meng first one to shoot Pritam, when Pritam responded need Minister of Law to step in.

LHL shoot WP in his rally about their lack of response on plan towards Covid response in the past 6 months when they already release their manifesto.

Ivan Lim play mother when accused of lousy character. Also took too long to respond to allegations.

Masagos say give candidates a chance to redeem themselves from the the things they have done in the past just because they have seen qualities in all their candidates that make them what the PAP thinks would make them good leaders who would serve Singaporeans well. Even before Ivan gave an official response. Fucking ridiculous when it's not even a candidate running in his GRC.

Don't need to even talk about the 10 million population issue which could be clarified anytime since SDP raised since many years ago but chose to keep quiet and only address it during GE.

There are other instances of stupid things that the PAP did. But the fact is they still won in AMK and still hold Super majority. So they lost a battle in Sengkang but won the war overall.

4844,"> # 18 community cases among 463 new COVID-19 infections in S'pore; total at 39,850

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) reported a preliminary 463 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Friday (12 June) noon, bringing the total to 39,850.

> ""Based on our investigations so far, there are 18 cases in the community, of whom eight are Singaporeans/permanent residents and 10 are work pass holders,"" said the MOH, adding that the vast majority are foreign workers living in dormitories.

> Of the community cases, five were classified as close contacts of earlier cases, and had already been placed on quarantine, it added.

> ""From our preliminary investigations, another five cases were picked up from our active surveillance and screening of workers in essential services and persons working at dormitories,"" said the MOH.

> Epidemiological investigations are ongoing for the remaining eight cases.

> The ministry added that more details will be provided in its press release issued at night.

> Dozens of clusters linked to foreign worker dorms have been identified thus far, including Singapore's largest cluster of over 2,700 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol, followed by Sungei Tengah Lodge, Jurong Penjuru Dormitory, Tuas View Dormitory and Cassia @ Penjuru.

> The five are among the 25 dorms that have been gazetted as isolation areas.

> About 10 per cent of some 400,000 such workers who live in dorms have been cleared of the infection, said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo on 1 June during a press conference.

> Over 20,000 infected foreign workers have recovered, she added.

> The story will be updated later at night.

> MOH STATEMENT IN FULL

> With 754 more patients discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities on Thursday, 27,286 cases – 69.3 per cent of the total tally – have fully recovered from the infection.

> Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while two are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Over 11,000 patients with mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Apart from 25 patients who have died from COVID-19 complications, 10 others who tested positive for the virus have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and another three, including the 44-year-old male Indian national who died on Monday, whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.

> ""Only cases where the attending doctor or pathologist attributes the primary or underlying cause of death as due to COVID-19 infection will be added to the COVID-19 death count,"" said the MOH in previous press releases, adding that the method of assessment is consistent with international practices for classifying deaths.

> As of 8 June, the ministry has conducted 488,695 swab tests, of which 284,963 were done on unique individuals. This translates to around 85,700 swabs conducted per 1 million total population, and about 50,000 unique individuals swabbed per 1 million total population.

> On Thursday, the MOH also added two more public places to a list of locations – first published on 25 May – visited by infectious cases in the community for over 30 minutes. A FairPrice Xtra outlet at JEM was visited on 6 June from 3pm to 4pm, while Pioneer Mall was visited on Monday from 9am to 10.15am.

> The list – which excludes residences, workplaces, healthcare facilities, and public transport – will be updated on a rolling 14-day basis or one incubation period.

4853,"> # Forum: Singapore-bashing over treatment of migrant workers is unwarranted

> Nominated MP Anthea Ong asked if the Government would consider issuing an apology to the migrant workers under lockdown in dormitories (Govt's response to outbreak will be reviewed after crisis, May 5). And Mr Andy Chew Teck Huat suggested that Singaporeans need to apologise for the state these workers are now in (All of us guilty of poor treatment of foreign workers, May 7).

> Living conditions at foreign workers' dormitories are strictly within the purview of the employers and workers. This is a commercial arrangement.

> Thus, if there is any violation related to the living conditions, then the dormitory operator and the employer should bear the consequences and be taken to task.

> Why does the nation need to apologise to the migrant workers? The Government does not operate the dormitories or employ the workers.

> Also, if the migrant workers have any grievances, there are many avenues they can turn to.

> For instance, the Ministry of Manpower's foreign manpower management division oversees workplace standards for foreign workers and enforces foreign workforce policies.

> And there are several migrant worker organisations that can address their needs.

> The recent Singapore-bashing over the coronavirus outbreak among migrant workers has gone to the extreme.

> While Singapore may be indebted to these migrant workers, let us not forget that they are here to make enough money so that they can return to their home countries to lead a more comfortable life.

> In Singapore, these workers are not underpaid or short-changed.

> It is a win-win situation for both parties.

> In fact, the care shown by the Government can be seen during this Covid-19 period. In some other countries, the costs of accommodation, food and virus testing for such workers are borne by their employers or embassies.

> But in Singapore, the Government has taken it upon itself to bear the costs.

> Let us be fair to Singaporeans and stop this bashing.

> Lee Kek Chin

Public  health experts have urged authorities to ensure travellers serving  quarantine will submit test samples on time to minimise the risk of  imported infections spreading into the community.

Dr  Joseph Tsang Kay-yan, co-chairman of the Medical Association's advisory  committee on infectious diseases, said designating hotels for  quarantine purposes could help plug current loopholes.

""Now  there isn't a centralised quarantine arrangement \[for travellers\]. If  there is a designated place for quarantine, \[government\] staff can be  there to monitor,"" Tsang said.

He  noted that those who were currently quarantined could leave their  locations after 14 days, even if they had not received results of their  second test.

Hong  Kong's health authorities warned of a worrying surge in untraceable  Covid-19 cases as they reported 23 new infections on Thursday, while  also ordering kindergartens across the city to close due to nearly 180  outbreaks of upper respiratory tract infections.

5125,"Good concise answer. A few more possible push and pull factors I can think of:

Push to opposition: Negative perception of the gutter politics and distraction from the real issues at hand, the unlevel playing field for campaigning.

Pull to opposition: Greater ability to understand and reach out to a newer generation of voters (both in terms of the technology i.e social media, and also in how the parties used these platforms), commendable leadership from Pritam Singh, both in their strategy (EC could be a distraction tactic after all), and in handling the Raeesah Khan incident

2 more observations:

1) IMHO the incumbent was always going to be at a disadvantage after the spike in COVID-19 cases, and holding the election early was always going to be about damage limitation.

2) Not really a push or pull factor, but the carrot-and-stick approach that was once used is increasingly less effective on the electorate (i.e people are increasingly indifferent to Estate upgrades and fearmongering)",-0.008299999999999974,7/11/2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/how12c/what_happened_to_the_pap/fxkh1td/

5137,"But landlords can defer mortgage repayments including interest as of 31 March, and even mortgage equity withdrawal loans as of 30 April. In view of these measures, not offering discounts to tenants, especially those in need, is plainly rent-seeking behaviour.

The reality is, signing a new rental contract will have a collapse in rent. If landlords wish to cut off their noses in spite, don't blame willing and able renters from doing the same by breaking their contract and moving to a much cheaper apartment.

Individuals with investment property loans can even apply to refinance or reprice their loans, without being subject to the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) and mortgage servicing ratio (MSR). Consequently, individuals who do not meet TDSR and MSR will not need to commit to a debt repayment plan to repay 3% of their outstanding loan amount over 3 years. 

Borrowers can choose to extend the loan tenure by up to the corresponding deferment period.
 After the deferment period, the loan amount together with the interest accrued on the 
deferred principal amount will be fully amortised over the remaining loan tenure (i.e. no 
balloon repayment).
 The deferment will not cause the loan to be reflected as a restructured loan in the 
borrower's credit bureau report.

5138,"> # COVID-19 tally in S'pore crosses 39,000 mark with 422 new cases; one S'porean among 5 community infections

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) reported a preliminary 422 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Thursday (11 June) noon, bringing the total to 39,387.

> ""Based on our investigations so far, there are five cases in the community, of whom one is a Singaporean and four are work pass holders,"" said the MOH, adding that the vast majority are foreign workers living in dormitories.

> The ministry said more details will be provided in its press release issued at night.

> Dozens of clusters linked to foreign worker dorms have been identified thus far, including Singapore's largest cluster of over 2,700 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol, followed by Sungei Tengah Lodge, Jurong Penjuru Dormitory, Tuas View Dormitory and Cassia @ Penjuru.

> The five are among the 25 dorms that have been gazetted as isolation areas.

> Some 400,000 such workers live in dorms here in Singapore, of which about 10 per cent have been cleared of the infection, said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo on 1 June during a press conference.

> Over 20,000 infected foreign workers have recovered, added Teo.

> The story will be updated later at night.

> MOH STATEMENT IN FULL

> With 655 more patients discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities on Wednesday, 26,532 cases – 68 per cent of the total tally – have fully recovered from the infection.

> Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while three are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Over 12,000 patients with mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Apart from 25 patients who have died from COVID-19 complications, nine others who tested positive for the virus have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and two whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.

> ""Only cases where the attending doctor or pathologist attributes the primary or underlying cause of death as due to COVID-19 infection will be added to the COVID-19 death count,"" said the MOH in previous press releases, adding that the method of assessment is consistent with international practices for classifying deaths.

> As of 8 June, the ministry has conducted 488,695 swab tests, of which 284,963 were done on unique individuals. This translates to around 85,700 swabs conducted per 1 million total population, and about 50,000 unique individuals swabbed per 1 million total population.

> On Tuesday, the ministry added one more public place to a list of locations – first published on 25 May – visited by infectious cases in the community for over 30 minutes. Hougang Green Shopping Mall at 21 Hougang Street 51 was visited on 3 June from 12pm to 1pm.

> The list – which excludes residences, workplaces, healthcare facilities, and public transport – will be updated on a rolling 14-day basis or one incubation period.

> Among the linked cases, 51 cases were connected to clusters at foreign worker dormitories and 21 to non-dormitory clusters or other cases, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in its daily update.

> Three new clusters were found - at Westlite Woodlands dormitory, North Coast Lodge and at Cassia @ Penjuru.

> MOH said that 35 more cases have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 528 have fully recovered.

> Of the 943 confirmed cases who are still in hospital, most are stable or improving, while 31 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> There are 820 cases who are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19 being isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> 

> MASK UP, STAY HOME

> Authorities on Saturday issued more regulations on the wearing of masks to curb the community spread of COVID-19.

> Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan said that it will be compulsory to wear masks on public transport to minimise transmission of the virus.

> From Sunday, people not wearing face masks will not be allowed to enter 40 markets managed by the National Environment Agency or its appointed operators.

> 

> All eateries will also face fines if their workers do not wear face masks or face shields, said the Singapore Food Agency.

> During the circuit breaker period, which lasts from Apr 7 to May 4, Singaporeans are to leave their homes only for essential activities such as buying food and groceries.

> As of Friday, 40 fines and more than 3,100 ""stern warnings"" have been issued to members of the public for not complying with safe distancing measures.

> Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Friday appealed to older Singaporeans to stay at home for their own safety during the ""circuit breaker"" period.

5159,"Just because covid disproportionately affects older people doesn't mean younger people will not be affected at all. With a death rate of approximately 1% (this is a conservative estimate, i think WHO's estimate is more like 3%), if 60% of the sg population (5.6mil) are infected, 33600 people will die. That's unacceptable.

Regarding HCQ&ZPACK, your comment about how it blocks viral binding to ACE2 is unsubstantiated at best and possibly completely wrong. Think you would have to do EM to know for sure.

These lockdown measures are indeed awful and extreme. The economic consequences are severe. People are losing their jobs. But covid is not just the flu. It's much, much worse, and the people of Singapore should take it more seriously.

I think our best strategy right now is to source out cases when they appear, quarantine those people close to them, make sure the cluster is small. The hope is that circuit breaker measures reduce the number of asymptomatic people (stay at home, don't spread it to anyone, naturally clear virus) or presymptomatic people (stay at home, symptoms appear, get tested and get quarantined at NCID). This reduces the amount of infectious individuals that can spread it to other people. If it works, measures can be slowly relaxed, we can go back to where we were in Feb. It is *not true* that ""we are all gonna get it at some point anyway"", especially in a small country like Singapore where contact tracing is possible.

Ps, I'm not a virologist/epidemiologist, but a PhD student in integrated immunology. I know enough to understand that we have to listen to experts and listen to the govt instead of adopting our own strategy.

I live and work in johor but I have extended family in singapore, and I am really surprised that somehow singaporeans are not taking this stay at home thing more seriously. not just the young, but the elderly!

singapore has about ~15% of malaysia's population. the infected cases and the surge in new cases that singapore is seeing in the past week is so worrying.

I know a big portion of the numbers in singapore is from migrant workers. in malaysia, we have about ~500 positive cases from migrant workers. we are still testing them including undocumented ones like illegal migrants, refugees from rohingya and so on.

the point is, in proportion to singapore population, the covid numbers are big - but singaporeans are still not taking this as seriously as they should (?)

I watched PM Lee (speaks perfect Bahasa Melayu by the way, what a leader) on CNA and it is obvious he is frustrated that people are not taking him seriously on this covid threat. Almost as if he is saying, I am so sorry I am making your life inconvenient, but please!

anyway just a sharing from your neighbor in an MCO.

> MORE LIFTING OF BORDER RESTRICTIONS

> Advertisement

> This latest initiative follows the earlier lifting of border restrictions for visitors from Australia, excluding Victoria state, Brunei Darussalam, New Zealand and Vietnam.

> 

> As of 12pm on Oct 29, CAAS said it had approved 1,375 applications from these places and received 602 visitors. None of the visitors tested positive for COVID-19 upon arrival.

> 

> CAAS said both mainland China and Victoria state have comprehensive public health surveillance systems and ""displayed successful control"" over the spread of COVID-19.

> 

> Over the past 28 days, mainland China and Victoria state has had a virus local incidence rate of 0.00009 and 0.099 per 100,000 respectively. The risk of importation from these places is low, CAAS added.

> 

> CAAS said it will update the travel advisory to allow travel to mainland China and all of Australia. Travellers are advised to check the entry requirements imposed by these countries and take the necessary precautionary measures.

> 

> VISITORS RESPONSIBLE FOR MEDICAL BILLS

> Visitors entering under the Air Travel Pass can expect to receive their PCR test results within 12 to 48 hours. After taking the PCR test, visitors must take private transportation, taxi, or private hire car from the airport to their declared place of accommodation, said CAAS.

> 

> ""They must remain isolated at the accommodation until the test result is confirmed to be negative. Checks will be made to ensure that this is adhered to. After being notified of their negative test results, visitors will be allowed to go about their activities in Singapore,"" CAAS added.

> 

> To facilitate the contact tracing process, visitors must download and register for the TraceTogether app on their mobile devices prior to departing for Singapore. They must also keep it activated during their stay and not delete it for 14 consecutive days after leaving Singapore.

> Should they subsequently test positive for COVID-19 within 14 days after leaving Singapore, they will be required to upload data in the app upon request by the Ministry of Health (MOH).

> CAAS reminded visitors that they are responsible for their medical bills related to COVID-19 while in Singapore.

> This includes costs related to tests and isolation imposed on visitors for public health reasons should they be suspected of being infected with COVID-19, as well as medical treatment for COVID-19.

> Visitors can apply for the single-entry Air Travel Pass, at no charge, between seven and 30 calendar days prior to their intended date of entry into Singapore. More details on the conditions of the Air Travel Pass, application requirements and process can be found online.

The linked article does mention all the online data transport the app engages in. So if the app was DESIGNED to send information out maliciously, this can be identified using a check of the underlying framework OpenTrace / BlueTrace (open sourced by the TT team) or network sniffing or reverse engineering of the apk. 

>What stood out to me immediately was the absence of backend host strings (e.g. api.myawesomeapp.com) or API calls, which is (almost) always the first thing to look out for when inspecting applications. Developers of applications with significant resources or risk typically harden their applications by packaging critical functionality such as encryption and data transport in low level libraries and calling them via JNI, effectively protecting critical functionality from inspection with basic tooling and script kiddies.
>However, that's not the case with TraceTogether: all online functionality was pointing to Firebase SDK, from User Authentication via OTP (PhoneAuthProvider) to records uploading with Firebase Storage.



And that's not hard to do and in fact it's done for a lot of controversial apps like TikTok to find out what endpoints it's sending data to.

I'm not talking about the GST increase dude. **I'm saying that people will spend more money if reopening is successful, so the government would get more GST money relative to now cause it's 7% on top of each transaction. More tourism & event spending == more GST government income.**

> The world is currently facing its worst ever crisis since the 1929 Great Depression, and the last thing you can ever hope for is for all of this to blow over like SARS and all. I will reiterate this again: vaccines take numerous years to not only develop, perfect and test, but to manufacture in a large scale that becomes applicable to the general populace. There is a reason why we are running hundreds of different kinds of vaccines everyday, and that's because we have taken into account the fact that most of them will fail and that hopefully, only one would meet our criteria for deployment. Until then, it's best to adapt to COVID and our rapidly changing environment.

Sure, but you still want to deploy as quickly as possible. If you want to roll-out an improved 2.0 version, there's time for that. Meanwhile, people are suffering from reduced employment.

> Furthermore, let me be frank on the matter that this is not a short-term issue (it is far from it, but not to the point where all of us will have COVID around until we die). The pathogen has proven itself to be contagious enough and throughout the entire world, US figures showed no signs of stopping, other developing powers are taking a hit (and well China, do you really believe their figures?). The only reason why you and a few others here might think that this is a short-term issue is because of SARS, in that we have defeated it in just a number of months overall.

I think it's short term because there are multiple Phase 3 vaccine trials showing promising results. Nothing to do with SARS. Also, I mean short-term in that it'll take a couple years (or at most a few) before we figure it out, not months. But in terms of a national budget, that's pretty short term.

5282,OK let's put it this way. Assuming ktv opens now and covid will stay on mics for a long period. You going to trust the previous group had their covers on the entire time and bring your friends/family along? I'm not even saying they are malicious for removing the covers. Everyone takes off their masks every now and then but the difference is you don't stay in a closed noise isolated room for 3 hours.

There was a huge shortage of tradesman, IT professionals, Pilots, Project Manager, Engineers. 

The problem was that people during school fell into gang violence and drugs. This in turn made them leave school without any qualifications. So to summarise. The U.K. didn't have a job shortage problem, it was primarily an education issue or maybe even an issue at home with parents. The U.K. failed to force integration of migrant families into the U.K. and as such they felt different to their own culture and different to the U.K. culture.",-0.033500000000000085,22/10/2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/jf8p8c/i_recently_moved_to_uk_after_living_in_singapore/g9jxmxk/

5355,">Many of these folks are remotely working for their Singapore employers but many can't for long due to tax implications from working outside Singapore borders.  This is forcing them to go on unpaid leaves.  Obviously they are important for their SG employers else they would have been fired by now.

fair enough these people are not necessarily unemployed in India, but are on employment/work pass in Singapore.

If tax implications (as you cited) or other administrative concerns (unpaid leaves, etc. ) are the reasons, these are just inconveniences and risks/costs to bear for hiring foreign nationals.

​

>What they are asking for is to be allowed to re enter into Singapore so they can physically continue to work for their Singapore employers.

>I am not sure why this is being referred to as they being entitled or they being unemployed?

i think it sounds entitled because these foreign nationals wants to put pressure on Singapore for their own benefit of working in Singapore.

at the end of the day, i dont see any justifiable reason for Singapore to accept the risk of admitting these foreign nationals from India (where covid-19 is not well managed) just to appease the employment situation for these group of foreign nationals. 

To these group of unfortunate foreign nationals : just suck it up and bear the inconveniences (work remotely for as long as u can or lose the job in SG and reapply at a later date) or probably the more straightforward solution is to **find a job in India**. 

For SG-based company: time to source/train singaporeans or at the very least have workers from a broader range of countries as well. let's not make it a case that Indian workers/talents are irreplaceable.",-0.02820000000000006,14/10/2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/jaaw11/indian_nationals_ask_their_govt_to_hold_talks/g8qzvt7/

But one thing is to be noted - the company knew she had the potential, so in spite of all the shots fired, they do put in some effort in nurturing her, eventually promoting her to supervisor. 

There is a catch too… her many years of being toughened up at the company made her a capable and super-achieving, but unfriendly and not-so-approachable colleague.

Can't go clubbing, can't go out with friends, and so on. All work and no play is no good. People want some kind of outlet for fun. 
* Physical retail sector which was already suffering, gets hit with a double whammy by covid. Almost everyone now is used to ordering at least some things online and having it delivered to their homes, where because of WFH it is almost guaranteed that there is someone to receive the package. 
* Many people are suffering financially, especially in hard hit sectors. But many people also still have jobs and have not felt the pinch (that is likely coming next year).

5447,"I'm not sure if it's advisable to forgo the emergency fund. The idea of an E fund is to provide you with cushion in case you lose your income. I personally experienced this, where I left my previous place and couldn't find a job for a whole year. I managed to stretch my savings for a whole year before I found another job and was down to my last few dollars before my first pay came in. so I will say E funds are important. 6 months is a guide, but if u can't build 6 months e fund then you can always scale it down. If you can't have 6 months expenses worth, at least have one or two. 

I know you're worried about the debt and as myself and many have pointed out it's better to pay off as fast as you can, BUT no matter how fast you pay it off, it's still a long term thing. E funds should get more priority because you never know when you'll need that extra bit of cash, even if your current job is secure, you never know if you suddenly fall ill or something essential in the house breaks and you need the funds to replace or repair it (touch wood). 

That said, only you know your own financial situation best, what we say here are only advice and not golden rules. If you want to learn more about finances, you can check out the Institute of Financial Literacy run by MAS and Singapore Poly. They often run free classes on things like insurance and investment, and they teach u on neutral grounds (as in, they're not affiliated to companies like insurance companies and will not be selling you any products like an MLM or one of those McDonald's insurance agents) (edit: they got a module on debt management, might be more useful for you!

5448,"> # 7 community cases amongst 451 new COVID-19 infections in Singapore; total close to 39,000

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) reported a preliminary 451 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Wednesday (10 June) noon, bringing the total to 38,965.

> ""Based on our investigations so far, there are seven cases in the community, of whom three are Singaporeans/permanent residents and four are work pass holders.,"" said the MOH, adding that the vast majority are foreign workers living in dormitories.

> The ministry said more details will be provided in its press release issued at night.

> Dozens of clusters linked to foreign worker dorms have been identified thus far, including Singapore's largest cluster of over 2,700 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol, followed by Sungei Tengah Lodge, Jurong Penjuru Dormitory, and Tuas View Dormitory.

> The four are among the 25 dorms that have been gazetted as isolation areas.

> Some 400,000 such workers live in dorms here in Singapore, of which about 10 per cent have been cleared of the infection, said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo on 1 June during a press conference.

> Over 20,000 infected foreign workers have recovered, added Teo.

> The story will be updated later at night.

> MOH STATEMENT IN FULL

> On Tuesday, the ministry added one more public place to a list of locations – first published on 25 May – visited by infectious cases in the community for over 30 minutes.

> Hougang Green Shopping Mall at 21 Hougang Street 51 was visited on 3 June from 12pm to 1pm.

> The list – which excludes residences, workplaces, healthcare facilities, and public transport – will be updated on a rolling 14-day basis or one incubation period.

> With 509 more patients discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities on Tuesday, 25,877 cases – 71.5 per cent of the total tally – have fully recovered from the infection.

> Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while three are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Over 12,300 patients with mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Apart from 25 patients who have died from COVID-19 complications, nine others who tested positive for the virus have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and two whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.

> ""Only cases where the attending doctor or pathologist attributes the primary or underlying cause of death as due to COVID-19 infection will be added to the COVID-19 death count,"" said the MOH in previous press releases, adding that the method of assessment is consistent with international practices for classifying deaths.

> As of 1 June, the ministry has conducted 408,495 swab tests, of which 264,393 were done on unique individuals. This translates to around 71,700 swabs conducted per 1 million total population, and about 46,400 unique individuals swabbed per 1 million total population.

I am not training to be an athlete either. Science has proven that taking a walk does wonders for your physical and mental health. Pre Covid-19 pandemic, I always took a walk at Bishan Park during the evenings, near my place. It clears my mind, and its way better (physically) than prolonged hours of nua-ing on my bed or staring at the computer screen. 

Nowadays, I still go for a brisk walk after dinner. But its walk and go home. Nothing else. No detours to go shopping or whatsoever. And trust me there are fuckers who are calling me out for that. I can't help the crowd levels. And as far as I know nobody is jogging alongside me. 

You know, I am getting fucking fed-up with some overzealous and kiasi Redditors (and real-life Singaporeans) who are advocating that we close down every single damn thing like parks. Closure of stadiums was quite hard for me to understand though it doesn't affect me at all because I have never used it. Covid-19 is scary. Yes. I get it. Stay at home - I totally understand.

5512,"> That's clearly silly talk. If a bubble tea shop owner bought 100% of their milk requirements 5 years ahead, would you say that's a savvy move, and  at the time, under the economic and financial circumstances, they were more than willing to pay for the risk offset?

That's false equivalency. Milk has a vastly lower expiry date and cannot be kept for the same period as oil, resulting in the need for higher turnover and storage costs. Milk has also proven to be a more stable commodity than oil. A bubble tea shop has also vastly more volatile demand as compared to airlines. A bubble tea's shop requirements for milk 5 years in the future is much more uncertain than the fuel requirement of airlines.

> COVID was something that was unpredictable and unprecedented, which is why you do not overhedge to their extent.

If you accounted for every black swan risk, you would be left bankrupt from the start.

> You don't know if the circumstances of the airline industry will change, and you have no fucking idea if your financial capabilities and priorities will have to change. That's why you do not overbuy ahead of time. 

But you do, and you can calculate it. The benefits of certain hedging strategies do weigh more than the risks and costs. You can take in some amount of st.dev and account of changes in demand/revenue over a normal curve. Right now, computers in Raffles place and CBP are doing VaR simulations to calculate that. COVID is what we call a tail risk, and the mathematical effects of that can better be left to the risk analysts.

> None of the other airlines do it to this extent, so what excuse do you have? That all other airlines were careless but lucky but SIA were prudent and unlucky?

Now we're discussing different hedging strategies, which is different from the ""hedging as gambling"" false statements that I'm seeing here. We can spend all day discussing the mathematical basis of SIA's hedging models and the merits of MoNtE cArLo. It stands that SIA's hedging models eventually turned up wrong.

> Simply put, don't buy what you can't afford. 

But they could, that's the whole point. When accounting for 99% of scenerio analysis, they could afford it. That's literally how tail risk works, they are black swan events that are near impossible to account for. It's just so happens that we were super unlucky and got that 0.1% of the simulation. 

> If you buy a big house assuming that your salary will always keep up, don't be surprised that a sudden change in circumstance will give you problems in your financial commitments.

Suppose I'm 99% sure my salary will remain at 10k and above and I buy a HDB, and if I lose that 10k all at once, would you say that I was being irresponsible in buying a house, an essential good? Of course not.

First thing first, it's almost impossible for the labour machine to switch gears all of a sudden to accommodate local-friendly hiring simply because the wheels have been greased for way too many years now. Even with Covid in play, it's still going to take years to put our plans (if there's any) into action. I doubt our administration is going to force anything through the system at risk of pissing off the foreign companies. 

The foreigners know this so who can blame them for indulging in a bit of shit and giggles at our expense. 

Our system, designed to extract every single ounce of GDP growth at whatever costs, is now ill-equipped to change course in the face of Covid. Granted, we're not the only country in the shits but do you try to save the economy or save the jobs of Singaporeans? These two issues are mutually exclusive.

According to Omong Kosong Saya, Singapore used to be plagued by can openers attacking the people living in the atas regions. A young boy named Narcissus proposed an ingenious solution, to build a wall of canned button mushrooms along the canal at the present location of Bukit Timah Road. When the can openers attacked, their low quality blades were stuck in the tin cans. With the can opener problem solved, Narcissus earned great respect from the people, but also jealousy from other canned mushroom suppliers. The fourth most popular canned mushroom supplier, Mili, finally executed their order from NTUC. It was said that mushroom juice soaked the soil of the hill where they were opened. Because of Covid-19, estate cleaning was reduced, giving rise to the tin-covered hill.",0.037900000000000045,21/9/2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/iwrbxy/the_origin_of_the_legend_of_bukit_timah/g628kre/

don't get me wrong, I agree that it's demeaning and really really boggles the mind how a rich country like ours can't afford to take care of the workers we depend on (actually the reason is, probably, profits). we can, and should do better. obv, free market has failed and more regulations need to be put in place and actions need to be taken.

I am close to someone at CNA and the someone knows the reporter in person. The reporter is very seasoned professional and does not resort to click bait for the story. The story was pitched to CNA by the PR agency from the perspective of ""please keep vigilant because all it takes is one moment to contract covid"".

So Daviest (his brothers are Dave and Davier) did the interview and he did the same for mothership earlier as well. He mentioned that he was careful in general but at a party he basically let loose and shared drinks etc with people, which was how he suspected he contracted covid.

He then got ALOT of flak on social media because ppl say he irresponsible la, stupid la, because he go partying in a pandemic. essentially his interview drew him much flak. He then made a fuss about it and made a post on how the reporter twisted his story etc.

CNA then decided to change the title, but also posted the full transcript with the story, which is essentially saying that Daviest was full of shit.",-0.013499999999999956,6/9/2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gzgokr/channel_news_asia_inserts_false_narrative_into/fth84kg/

With covid, for some reason, people are working more. I feel more people are getting burned out from their angsty replies in emails when previously they are not (in office setting).

But a good organization will try to ensure employees to strike a balance, either having HR or middle management to engage the employees to strike a good balance. To take leave to rest and etc.

But a fuck care organization will just close their eyes and let things go. Then you realised colleagues who are burn out will start to DGAF and feel resentment towards the organization.

And this explains their decision to leave.

It's all psychology, they can be well paid but if the colleagues do not feel the support from organization or management, then what's the point of staying in this company?

Off course you can say every company is like this, if so, then I might as well leave this for a higher pay out there right? Since there's no reason for me to stay",-0.0408,29/8/2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/iij8hn/singaporeans_are_entitled_saw_this_posted_on/g37b9ue/

The guy you were replying to was unnecessarily rude, but he was insulting Christians and not the religion itself. 

IMO Christianity itself is perfectly fine, and maybe a good thing, even, but we have seen religious folk display a remarkable ability to explain away, forgive, and even defend obvious wrongdoings of fellow religious folk because they are unable to believe that there are fellow Christians who are evil/greedy/dishonest/wrong about some stuff despite their faith. 

Look at how positively Joseph Prince's claims about prayer-induced COVID-19 immunity were received, look at Kong Hee, welcomed back to the church like a hero - it is not that hard to believe that there might be people willing to defend this guy in this video.

Indian companies must have Indians in management. Under no circumstances should Indians be allowed in management positions in non-Indian companies. And Singaporeans must not be allowed in management positions in non-Singaporean companies. Sounds like a very good way to ensure TOP talent in organisations (sarcasm).

Having said that, while I do not agree with this suggestion because it's not meritocratic, if such a policy seems fair to the xenophobes and if such a policy would result in less racist vitriol from netizens, then I would wholeheartedly support it. The racism and xenophobia I see here is absolutely toxic. For social harmony, let there be nationality quotas in management of companies based on the company's country of origin if people think it's fair.

Not just to target economic growth or unemployment, but to preserve our way of life, people's mental health, balance other health risks (in UK, cancer detections are down 75% since the start of the lockdown) and avoid unnecessary panic like one you're experiencing.

I don't think so, actually. Those who would reject 3k/month in construction are most likely looking for an office job. It's not about the pay for them, but about the nature of the job. 

We should be comparing the market with other blue-collar workers in manual labour jobs.

Look at how many people are doing food delivery, even before the Covid-19 issue. Another blue-collar role, nothing glamorous about it too. But they're doing it because money is money. Many Singaporeans aren't in a position to be choosy about where it comes from. 

Another example would be seafreight and airfreight cargo handlers. Most earn less than 2k/month working 5.5 - 6 days a week and it's still back-breaking work at the end of the day. I'm pretty sure many of them would go for it if there was a manual labour job that paid 3k/month, even with the increased physical risk of working in a construction site.

6090,"> # Some people in S'pore wearing badges to ward off Covid-19 but they don't work

> Some people in Singapore are going beyond wearing face masks as a precautionary measure against Covid-19.

> They are putting their trust in body-worn badge-like devices, such as the ""EA mask"" badges and ""health tag"" lanyards, that have been marketed as being able to inactivate viruses and kill bacteria.

> These smallish, light-weight devices are particularly popular among senior folks, who probably find such gadgets more comfortable than donning face masks in the hot and humid weather.

> Here are some examples:

> These devices are being sold online, and even at high-end departmental stores such as Takashimaya.

> On the product's website, EA masks sell for S$16.50.

> They have even been misleadingly advertised to ""work harder than a conventional mask"", because of the chlorine dioxide that the gadgets release.

> The advertising copy read, ""EA Mash and EA Bear gives you a 1m radius protection around your body 24/7"".

> Japan study finds body-worn devices do not kill influenza viruses

> A 2017 study in Japan looked into four brands of such devices and found that the viral load in the air is similar to that found close to all devices tested, suggesting that these devices are not effective at all.

> The study said:

> ""Viral loads were found to be similar between viral samplings in the air collected from the site close to the device for all devices and in the controlled air, indicating that no virucidal activity was found against the air-borne influenza viruses with selected devices in these conditions.""

> Malaysian agency warns of tags that claim to kill Covid-19

> More recently, Malaysiakini also reported on March 30 that Malaysia's National Poison Centre issued a Facebook post to debunk claims that such products can ward off Covid-19 for users.

> Moreover, the ""heath tags"" lanyards that emit chlorine dioxide can act as irritants toward the respiratory system, the authorities warned.

> The greater concern among the authorities is that people might blindly believe in these body-worn devices, which gives users a false sense of security, and even use them as substitutes for masks.

> Such products have created much online chatter as well, with comments dismissing them and their purported efficacy:

> When in doubt, some common sense helps:

> Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan has been admitted to the isolation ward after experiencing a fever.

> According to Khaw's Instagram, he had just finalised the negotiations for the Johor Bahru–Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) when his temperature shot up.

> Khaw assured everyone that this was most likely not due to a Covid-19 infection, but said that it could very well be dengue as his area is a hot zone.

> Khaw has also done the swab test. He also revealed that he had dengue before and it was ""not pleasant"".

> However Khaw, who recently announced his retirement from politics, still managed to find the whole predicament somewhat amusing, noting:

> ""I started my career in the Health Ministry. After 42 years, I would not expect to exit the stage in bed as a patient!""

6213,"I'm not an economist but you said minimum wage hurt low income workers by pushing them out of jobs. Isn't that because either A, the companies closed shop and close stores or B, they have other pools of manpower to choose from. 
In our case since Covid hits the fan, I think this is the perfect opportunity for companies to price in the costs of higher wage workers for their products or services. And B) there are no other pools of manpower to choose from in Singapore. Minimum wage covers Locals as well as Foreigners but because foreigners now have the foreign levy tax, it actually costs more to hire foreigners than locals if the minimum wage is implemented so in this case minimum wage helps. 
The only issue with having minimum wage is wage stagnation for low income workers is a high probability. 
However I argue that even with the so called progressive wage system the government has, wages has only increased by a small percentage over the years.

Yes, because we got to the point where hardly anyone in the community is sick. So even if many small groups of people break social distancing measures, the odds are in our favour that none of the rule-breakers were infected. 

If the % of infectious people in the community is 0.1%, if you gather a random bunch of 100 people to have a mass orgy, there's a 90% chance that all of them are uninfected so there's no Covid virus to transmit. (0.999\^100 = 0.90)

But things can easily get out of hand. If the infected percentage crawls up to 1%, any group of 100 people now has a 63% chance of containing an infected person.

A little context on my situation, I've just shifted home from ntu after the school asks all their local students to shift home, and hence I'm back into the abusive household I'm in. I know it's covid period now so it's hard to seek shelter on the outside, but I was wondering if there was anywhere I can seek help or solace from? It's terrible having to eat the meds since 
1, I don't need them (I got them because my hypochrondriac mother convinced the doctor I needed them) 
2. They have bad side effects on me (my appt was cancelled due to covid so I never had the  chance to tell my doctor they don't work) 

I threw the meds out the window, and she gave me another and said, it's either the meds out the window or me out the door.  Kinda wished it wasn't covid so I can look for a job that provides employment and accommodation. I'm financially crippled from her so I don't have cash on me, but I suppose I'm planning to leave within this week.

Say it is a time of crisis, when policies need to be paseed quickly. *both sides then recognise the need for action* so thus the policy is put into place*. For example, the japan covid buget. The opposition had issues with it but they passed it due to the urgency of the situation. They instead chose to ammend the budget over time to become better. The incumbent agreed. Speed and quality were both not sacrifiaed

And otherwise, it shoild  be obvious that if one party has a monopoly on politics, they will be able to pass whatever policy they want - *good or bad*. In other words, like in north korea, without checks, the government can put out completely unfavourably policies with no checks. In such a case, the policies are unlikely to be representative and will not be favourable to tue people. For example... well, 2017 presidential elections. In reality, this is not very far from say north korea or china. It is very possible, though unlikely, for such major abuses to happen.

> SINGAPORE: This being the last weekend before much of Singapore grinds to a halt on Apr 7 - when more ""circuit breakers"" kick in to contain the spread of COVID-19 - shoppers were out in force and many thronged eateries before dining out is forbidden.

> 

> On Saturday, snaking queues were spotted at some malls, with many people rushing last-minute buys, presumably for work-from-home arrangements. Groups were also seen crowding popular food haunts such as Holland Village and Newton Food Centre.

> Come Tuesday, under sweeping safe-distancing measures announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, most workplaces will close. Retail outlets, save those providing essential services, must shutter for a month. F&B outlets can stay open but can only offer takeaway or delivery services.

> The ministerial task force to tackle the pandemic has repeatedly urged Singaporeans to go out only when necessary and advised that if they do have to go out, to return home as soon as possible. They will still be allowed to go out and exercise. Here's a handy tool to check how crowded a park is: safedistparks.nparks.gov.sg/

> Thousands of people who could unknowingly have been infected with Covid-19 - because they had been in close contact with patients - are being tested in a major exercise to look at the real rates of coronavirus infection in the community.

> The National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) is approaching people who were placed under quarantine from the start of contact tracing in January until April 4.

> The aim is to determine the prevalence of infection and to assess exposure risks among close contacts of Covid-19 patients, whether they are at home or at work, or in social settings. The rates will also allow NCID to better estimate the number of undiagnosed cases among close contacts.

> Serology tests will check blood samples for antibodies that would have developed if the person had already been infected. Some might have been asymptomatic, had mild symptoms or were never diagnosed to be Covid-19 positive.

> Associate Professor Ng Oon Tek, a senior consultant at NCID, said that all participants in the study would have already completed their quarantine orders.

> Participants will have to answer a questionnaire via phone or government e-form, which includes questions about exposure risks related to the patient tested positive. Thus, they would need to be able to identify the infected person they could have been in contact with, either by name or face.

> Participants will also be required to provide a blood sample for antibody testing using a test developed by Duke-NUS Medical School.

> The study includes household, work and social close contacts of Covid-19 patients.

> NCID has approached about 2,500 household contacts and 1,800 social contacts so far. It aims to approach about 3,000 social contacts and 2,300 work ones.

> In total, NCID has identified 1,100 contacts who are appropriate and agreeable to participate in the study. It hopes to enrol 2,000 contacts for the study, for which results should be available in two months.

> The study is part of a set of three studies spearheaded by NCID. Another involves healthcare workers, and the third is on the rest of the population.

> NCID said improved understanding of asymptomatic Covid-19 infections can lead to more effective transmission risk assessments and estimations of fatality rates.

> ""In addition, exposure risk factors for Covid-19 can offer insight into the nature of transmission, informing guidance and policies to stop its spread,"" it added.

6973,"I would just like to throw some timelines here for everyone's consideration. 

​

**Regarding banning travellers from China**

January 14 - WHO statement saying there is ""no clear evidence of human to human transmission"".January 22 - WHO's statement saying that ""the data *suggests* human-to-human transmission is taking place in Wuhan, but more investigation is required to understand"".

January 23 - WHO tried to assess ""whether the outbreak constituted a public health emergency of international concern"". No consensus was reached at that time.

January 23 - Taiwan closes border to Wuhan residents.

January 28 - Hong Kong closes border crossings to Hubei residents.

January 30 - WHO confirms human-to-human transmission and ""reached consensus and advised the Director-General that the outbreak constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)"". WHO gave a risk assessment of very high for China, and high at the global level.

January 31 - Singapore closes border to all Chinese visitors.

Feb 6 - Taiwan closes border to all Chinese visitors.

March 11 - WHO made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic.

As of today, Hong Kong has never closed borders entirely to mainland China, only border crossings. It is quite evident that we are reactionary, reacting only immediately after WHO confirmed human-to-human transmission, and closed our borders.

​

**b. Mask situation**

January 29 - WHO's report says, ""a medical mask is not required, as no evidence is available on its usefulness to protect non-sick persons"" and ""wear a medical mask and seek medical care if experiencing fever, cough and difficulty breathing"". Also, ""Cloth (e.g. cotton or gauze) masks are not recommended under any circumstance."" \[[link](",0.016199999999999992,24/5/2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gpj6xc/4g_leaders_mishandled_covid19_crisis_from_the/frmekdl/
6974,"Ok, let's tackle your statements one by one.:  


**a. Regarding banning travellers from China**  
January 14 - WHO statement saying there is ""no clear evidence of human to human transmission"".  
January 22 - WHO's statement saying that ""the data *suggests* human-to-human transmission is taking place in Wuhan, but more investigation is required to understand"". 

January 23 - WHO tried to assess ""whether the outbreak constituted a public health emergency of international concern"". No consensus was reached at that time.

January 23 - Taiwan closes border to Wuhan residents.

January 28 - Hong Kong closes border crossings to Hubei residents.

January 30 - WHO confirms human-to-human transmission and ""reached consensus and advised the Director-General that the outbreak constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)"". WHO gave a risk assessment of very high for China, and high at the global level.

January 31 - Singapore closes border to all Chinese visitors.

Feb 6 - Taiwan closes border to all Chinese visitors.

March 11 - WHO made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic.

As of today, Hong Kong has never closed borders entirely to mainland China, only border crossings. It is quite evident that we reacted immediately after WHO confirms human-to-human transmission, and closed our borders. 

​

**b. Mask situation**

January 29 - WHO's report says, ""a medical mask is not required, as no evidence is available on its usefulness to protect non-sick persons"" and ""wear a medical mask and seek medical care if experiencing fever, cough and difficulty breathing"". Also, ""Cloth (e.g. cotton or gauze) masks are not recommended under any circumstance.""

Feb 1 - In Singapore, every household to be given 4 masks, and it is reiterated that ""only people who are unwell should be wearing them.""

Feb 19 - Hong Kong reports masks shortages for healthcare professionals. 

April 3 - Singapore is no longer discouraging people from wearing masks. Reusable mask made available for collection.

April 6 - WHO's report maintains that ""there is limited evidence that wearing a medical mask by healthy individuals in the households or among contacts of a sick patient, or among attendees of mass gatherings may be beneficial as a preventive measure."" Lastly, it also mentioned that ""**Medical masks should be reserved for health care workers.** ""

April 15 - In Singapore, masks made compulsory when leaving home.

We cannot compare ourselves to Taiwanese / HK / South Korean households where most of them were likely to have a stockpile of masks ready for their everyday use, prior to Covid-19. 

​

**c. Monitoring of quarantined people not tight enough?**

A little vague, not sure how to quantify tight or not tight enough. Should we be looking to compare when the other countries started imposing fines and penalties? Let me know.

> SINGAPORE: Working from home must be embraced as the new normal even as the country's ""circuit breaker"" is eased gradually from next month, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong on Saturday (May 23) as he urged employers to adjust their mindsets.

> 

> Singapore will exit its circuit breaker period as planned on Jun 1, with measures to be progressively lifted in three phases. Under the first phase, businesses that operate in settings with lower transmission risks will be allowed to open but authorities have stressed that telecommuting must be used to the ""maximum extent"".

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Some requirements have been put in place. For instance, employees should only return to work if they need specialised equipment and machinery that cannot be accessed from home, or if they need to fulfil legal requirements such as to complete contracts or transactions.

> ""On that basis, we expect most employees working in an office setting to continue working from home as they are presently doing,"" said Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force tackling the COVID-19 outbreak.

> Many employers and managers will need to adjust their mindsets to embrace this new normal, the minister added.

>

> Advertisement

> ""It's no longer about having all your staff physically present at work. Even if they have to be on site, consider if they really need to do so every day,"" he said, noting that ""hybrid arrangements"" could be made for employees to work from home for a few days in a week.

> 

> As for those who have to be in the office, employers must make sure that the work environment is safe by maintaining good ventilation and high hygiene standards. Employers can also put in place staggered work hours, he said.

> 

> ""All these workplace measures are critical in our fight against COVID-19,"" Mr Wong wrote. ""They will reduce the need for daily movement of people, and minimise the risks of the virus flaring up again.""

6989,"SINGAPORE - The National University of Singapore is planning to  reopen its campus for the new academic year on Aug 10, and will hold  some classes there and others online.

To minimise intermingling of students, it intends to divide up its  campuses into different zones. Students and faculty will have to keep  within their designated zone for all activities, including attending  classes and eating at canteens. Those taking up cross-faculty modules  that require them to step outside their designated zone will have to  take up the courses online.

Under the plans being drawn up, the university will be divided into  five zones. The mega Kent Ridge campus, with a population of about  40,000, will be split into three zones, while the Bukit Timah and Outram  campuses form the other two zones.

The seven student halls, five residential colleges and two student  residences, which hold about 10,500 students, will also be split up into  zones. This will mean that if a group of students share a zone on  campus, they will also share a zone in residences to avoid  intermingling.

With the bigger classes being taught online, no more than 50 per cent of students are expected to be on campus on any one day.

I get the apparent contradiction. I'm just saying I find it a superficial contradiction in the sense that, going by that logic, must we keep them locked away for the longest time (compared to other groups), to not contradict ""keeping them safe""? Aggressively trying to keep community transmission low is in itself a way to keep them safe. Relaxing measures is already the acceptance of increased risk. If an elderly is to catch covid with the relaxed measures, I think they would rather it be because they had family visiting (the cautious ones could always choose not to), than because seemingly healthy young individuals were lepaking with beer and ended up forming a cluster that then spread widely because of their mobility, and reached their isolated doors.

Ultimately my main point was still: we can be unhappy that the social restriction is still on the rest of us, but why complain that it's now legal to have people visiting aged parents? It doesn't take away anything from you, even if it's contradictory.

> SINGAPORE: Singapore reported 13 new COVID-19 cases as of noon on Saturday (Dec 5), including one in the community who had earlier been placed on quarantine.

> 

> Twelve cases were imported infections, of which 11 were placed on stay-home notice upon arrival in Singapore, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in its preliminary daily update.

> Advertisement

> The remaining case is a Singaporean who travelled to Indonesia under the Business Travel Pass. He took a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test upon return to Singapore on Nov 28 and self-isolated while waiting for his test result.

> The test came back negative on Nov 29 but he developed symptoms on Dec 2, and was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on Dec 4, MOH said.

> RESTAURANT SUSPENDED, MALL UNDER INVESTIGATION

> Gemma Steakhouse at National Gallery was ordered to suspend operations for 20 days, after COVID-19 rules were breached during a private Halloween dinner attended by about 75 people, said the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) on Friday.

> 

> ""Although the diners were seated at tables of up to five, CCTV footage showed that they intermingled on multiple occasions and did not wear their masks even when they were not eating/drinking,"" said MSE.

> Advertisement

> ""The footage also showed that the restaurant staff did not take reasonable steps to prevent the intermingling on their premises.""

> Under COVID-19 safety measures, social gatherings of groups of more than five outside an individual's residence are prohibited.

> Food and beverage outlets are also prohibited from accepting bookings from groups of larger than five, even if such groups are split across multiple tables. Intermingling between groups is also prohibited.

> 

> Meanwhile, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) said investigations into the large crowds seen outside Orchard Gateway on Friday night were under way.

> Photos circulated online showed a massive crowd of people outside the Foot Locker outlet at the mall, as well as police vehicles.

> STB said Foot Locker stores have ""received repeated advisories about crowd management but continue to hold events that draw large crowds"".

> As of Saturday, Singapore has reported a total of 58,255 COVID-19 cases.

The flaw is that without a principle ideological decision, parties like the PAP are weak to populist pressures since there isn't some sort of ideological core to ground them. Let's say HSK comes into power and what he thinks is ""right"" is to just give money out to people.

> SINGAPORE: The number of COVID-19 cases in Singapore crossed the 15,000 mark with 690 new infections reported as of noon on Wednesday (Apr 29).

> The vast majority of the new cases are work permit holders residing in foreign worker dormitories, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in its daily update of preliminary figures.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Six cases are Singaporeans or permanent residents.

> The new cases take the national total to 15,641.

> 

> ""We are still working through the details of the cases, and further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be issued tonight,"" the ministry added.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> MOH's director of medical services Kenneth Mak said during a media briefing on Tuesday that migrant workers living in dormitories who present symptoms of COVID-19 are isolated before they are tested to prevent the virus from potentially spreading to others

> He added that the number of COVID-19 cases may be higher than what is stated in the official report - which includes confirmed and verified infections - but the suspected cases will eventually be tested to confirm if they are infected, or if they have recovered.

> 

> The authorities on Tuesday also announced that healthcare capacity to deal with COVID-19 will be increased significantly in the next two months, with the total number of bed spaces for those with mild symptoms doubling by end-June.

When you mentioned China's covert operations to exercise influence and push forth their political narrative in Singapore, I immediately thought about social media (predominantly Facebook) during the days when local news were rife with reports about protest-ridden HK instead of COVID-19. 

Back then I couldn't help but notice how when an article by ST or CNA about the protests were posted, there would be a barrage of pro-China comments or assertations that may or may not be substantiated by any basis of fact.

This is not exactly a novel idea (in fact its a potential direction the Republicans  appear to pushing for), however, I think this idea does not give consideration to the far reaching consequences. 

Taking the assumption that no one want to die or spread the virus to their family members, if anyone gets diagnosed with covid 19, they'll want to have access to healthcare and be quarantined (to not spread it to their loved ones). 

While we have the resources to handle the numbers as it currently stands, once the numbers get too large, where will we house the infected? Assuming the ICUs fill up (which they will), are patients to be given a spot on a first come first serve basis?

Did you know that vaccine will not prevent infections?

> *Prevention of infection is not a criterion for success for any of these vaccines. In fact, their endpoints all require confirmed infections and all those they will include in the analysis for success,  the only difference being the severity of symptoms between the vaccinated and unvaccinated. Measuring differences amongst only those infected by SARS-CoV-2 underscores the implicit conclusion that the vaccines are not expected to prevent infection, only modify symptoms of those infected.*

7698,"> # Expenses incurred from working at home qualify for tax deductions

> Singapore

> WORKERS working from home can claim deduction against employment income for charges such as electricity and telecommunication expenses not reimbursed by employers.

> An Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras) spokesperson told The Business Times: ""Tax deduction against employment income is allowable for expenses incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of employment income. ""

> To qualify for deduction, the expenses must be incurred while carrying out official duties, not reimbursed by the employer, and not capital or private in nature.

> These expenses include the additional power and telecommunication bills incurred when employees are required to work from home. This is not limited to the ""circuit breaker"" period, the taxman said.

> Companies started having employees work from home upon the urging of the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), especially during the circuit breaker period from April 7.

> However, even when the circuit breaker was removed after June 1, the MOM has said that working from home should still be the default mode of working and businesses must adopt telecommuting to the maximum extent.

> Iras said that for those who have incurred work-related charges this year may claim for a deduction against employment income in next year's income tax filing. It also allows an equal apportionment basis among the working individuals in the same household, if there are more than one person working from home.

> Senoko Energy reported an approximately 30 per cent increase in the average monthly electricity consumption in April for customers that use advanced meters, as compared to the January-February period.

> Advanced meters allow electricity consumption to be measured at half-hourly intervals.

> James Chong, head of commercial division at Senoko Energy, said: ""While this is only reflective of a selected segment of our customer base, we expect to see a similar trend among our other residential customers, especially for families whose homes were unoccupied during office hours, pre-Covid.""

> For most households, it is not exactly clear if consumption has gone up or by how much during the circuit breaker period, as they use meters that require manual reading.

> A Keppel Electric spokesperson told BT that the Open Electricity Market retailer cannot comment on the usage of residential consumers for now. ""Most customers are on manual meters and SP Services only takes meter reads every two months. With the circuit breaker, they have also suspended meter reading for April and May. We will only know the actual readings later.""

> A Facebook post showed that SP Group's meter readers would not be visiting households to record their utility usage during the circuit breaker period, so April, May and June bills would be estimated consumption.

> The electricity tariffs before the goods and services tax decreased from 24.24 cents per kwh to 23.02 cents per kwh for the April to June quarter. This means that the average monthly electricity bill for a family living in a four-room Housing Board flat will decrease by S$3.89.

> As it may be difficult for an employee to calculate the exact amount of the allowable expenses that have been incurred as a result of working at home, Iras will accept the difference in electricity and telephone bills before and after working from home.

> For example, if the electricity bills before and after working from home are S$50 and S$60 respectively, the difference of S$10 can be claimed as deduction being expenses incurred for work purposes.

> Where government rebates have been provided, taxpayers have to ascertain the portion of the electricity expenses incurred for work purposes based on the amount of charges net of government rebates.

> As for broadband WiFi connection set up for work purposes, employees may claim the WiFi monthly subscription fees as a deduction. However, such one-time charges as installation or connection fee cannot be claimed because they are capital in nature.

> Further, if WiFi has been set up before working from home, no deduction can be claimed for such expenses. To claim the expenses incurred for working from home, taxpayers must keep for five years proper records on these expenses and documents such as confirmation from the employer stating the period of working from home.

He then apologises to his colleagues for going to work when sick and goes to see his GP (Preferably at a PHPC clinic so he only pays $10). GP checks him and if patient doesnt meet suspect critetia, GP gives him a 5 day MC and reminds him he CANNOT leave his house for 5 days.

If GP is worried enough, will call ambulance to send him to NCID. He needs to stay in clinic till ambulance arrives. Now sometimes if ambulance takes 3+ hours to arrive the GP will pass patient the referral letter and tell the patient to wait for the ambulance at home. This can only happen if his home is within walking distance. Ambulance then collects patient from his home and goes to NCID.

At NCID patient gets an Xray and swabbed if he is assessed to meet suspect criteria for COVID.

People simply believe what media or authority claims to be true. No longer do they bother to exercise their common sense. They keep saying they want freedom from tyranny yet they don't want to exercise their rights. I guess they don't truly deserve freedom.

the ugly truth whether You like it or not is regardless the pandemic, someone is going to die every single day, because of other circumstances like aging, accident, homicide, etc.

no humans on this planet can live forever.

peace and love

2) If certain ingredients are indeed from the covid impacted places,  and if there's no other suitable sources for the sane ingredients,  then they ""might "" be able not to serve you and change it BUT they should have informed you about the change when you use your voucher to claim the meal   .

Also I'm sure some people might not want to eat food being imported from those areas fearing virus traces and such lor

> More people in Singapore were caught meeting with others from different households.

> This was despite significantly fewer people being fined for not wearing masks and breaching Covid-19 safe-distancing measures here.

> Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli made this revelation in a Facebook post on June 1.

> Different households

> He wrote that there had been a 5 per cent increase in the number of people caught meeting with others from different households in the past week, compared to the week before.

> ""Our enforcement officers encountered people meeting up with buyers, chatting in groups in public spaces, exercising together in parks, and even a group of individuals from different households gathering and drinking together for a birthday celebration,"" he wrote.

> ""Such reckless behaviour compromises efforts to keep Singapore safe, and will not be tolerated. We must prevent a second wave of community spread.""

> Social gatherings outside of households are still prohibited in phase 1 of the post-circuit breaker period that started on June 2.

> Visiting elderly parents or grandparents is now permitted again, but it is limited to only two visitors from the same household per day.

> Fines decreased

> Masagos also noted that most Singaporeans have been following safe-distancing measures and wearing masks when outside of their homes.

> ""On 31 May, we had only three fines,"" he said in his post, recounting how 100 people were fined for not wearing masks in one day at the start of the enforcement period in April.

> Fines issued against breaches of safe distancing measures have come down from more than 250 fines a day in the initial period, to about 85 fines on May 31.

> Masagos commended the public's collective efforts to minimise social interactions that have led to Singapore reporting zero cases of Covid-19 infection in the community on June 1.

> ""We have averted a healthcare crisis so far, that could have put our healthcare workers and facilities under great stress. We can now concentrate on reviving the economy and avert a job crisis,"" he said.

Even before we entered this cb you kinda knew that at the end of it we would have to open up before a vaccine could be found.
Not sure what the status of the vaccine is right now but i would estimate that it would definitely not be available until the end of the year(maybe next 6-18 months)
Also having consecutive days of 0 covid19 cases means nothing because testing isnt that widely available yet(this could change in the near future where we could have enough tests to test everyone)
We also have to think about those who have been retrenched and the businesses that may not be around if we dont start the easing the measures which would only mean more unemployment in the near future just look at the us, something like 30mil unemployed which is a significant chunk of their working population.
If people cant go to work/find jobs it probably means that they can feed their families, people going broke, taking out their frustrations on their family members, maybe self harm etc.
Government would probably have to stimulate the economy(drawing on their reserves cause $600 can only sustain you maybe a few weeks maybe more if you have savings etc.) 
In the meantime we should be thinking about how we can get people to work if they cant wfh, think about the vulnerabilites of our transport system, 
Might have to rethink quite a few thinks if another infectious and more deadly virus appears in the future.

I don't think you can say that mask does nothing for people. If they are totally useless, why are medical personnel and doctors wearing them? Why are we trying to reserve masks for the frontline medical staff? I am very sure mask has its degree of effectiveness.

So an important issue is: *who are the ones who most need masks*, and *how do we get the masks to them*.

- I think people who are unwell should wear masks when they need to be out in public areas.

- People who have certain pre-exisitng medical conditions should be given masks. These are the people who are likely to develop serious health issues should they be infected by the covid virus.

- Maybe old folks should be given masks too. I don't know.

> Let CPF savings be a source of financial security at all times, not just in the distant future, urged NCMP Hazel Poa in Parliament on Wednesday (Sep 2). She said CPF members who have lost their jobs in the COVID-19 crisis should be allowed to borrow from their own CPF accounts and repay the loans after they find work. Ms Poa also suggested that the Government explore indexing CPF Life payments to inflation with the inflation adjustment paid by the Government, so that retirees are not left at the mercy of economic forces beyond their control.

This shows that the opposition party has the right people and a concrete plan ready in place to take over from the incumbent government when called upon to do so by the voting populace.",0.01200000000000001,7/2/2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hjpuko/ge_2020_latest_from_high_energy_prof_jamus/fwoes5y/

8497,"I am very late to this post, had some thoughts reading through your post & some of the comments yesterday but did not have time to comment. Now that I have some, here goes..

The debate shows the sad state of things currently in the USA. I guess it serves as a wake up call on how not to go down a similar path and end up like that?

In all honesty, I did not pay that much attention to online content during the previous elections. Perhaps it was due to Covid-19 that I registered for an account here (because I was bored WFH at the beginning of the pandemic), I cannot help but feel that the online space has gotten more toxic in general? During the elections, maybe 7 out of 10 of the comments on the news sites seem to be raging against the incumbent? It does seem to remain the same even after the elections.

Other than raging about the incumbent government, I also observe harsh & rude comments on race, religion, people and actions. I am not sure if it is prevalence of troll culture that cause such posts to increase.

IMO with the increased internet penetration & resulting ease of obtaining information, people are getting much more impatient nowadays. Tempers flare quickly and we demand immediate answers. Slowly but surely, this affects our relationships with others, and how we communicate with people face to face.

There is no going back to the olden days with this technology in place worldwide.

Then comes the quality of the information obtained by essentially everyone. How many would validate the things they read on the internet? It comes ""cheap"", because it is so easily obtained. I think this is a very big problem, and personally I think there is a need to advocate for good content and responsible information sharing. Make an effort to read about something from more sources, and soon realize which are the more credible ones. For commentaries, read up far and wide, even if you may not agree with them.

Pair this with echo chambers that form much more easily online as compared to one in the physical world, toxic (or any other type) environments can grow very quickly & become a self-sustaining ecosphere. E.g. look at Zaobao Facebook posts & the comments, especially if the post relates to something which is non-Chinese & it is a negative report.

Maybe these people think ""alike"" people are posting there anyway, and what they post would not matter because the ""others"" will not see it.

I think we should just go back to the basics - try to be civil to everyone. As mentioned earlier, try to be more patient and not immediately imagine & classify things in a manner that they only exist in dichotomy. Take time to reflect & think, as things are not only in black and white. More often than not, shades of gray are the norm instead of the 2 extremes.",-0.01690000000000013,10/1/2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/j2ifsi/what_singapore_can_learn_from_the_us_presidential/g7anu1j/

Take for example a construction company right now. The bulk of the labour is done by the migrant workers under work permit and the Singaporeans hired are PMETs. Project managers, accountants, etc. Hiring a foreign worker isn't cheap. There are several costs involved. 

Costs of dormitory ($600), salary ($800), meals ($150), transport ($100) and lastly the foreign worker levy ($300-$700). We can see that the foreign worker levy alone would be around 1/5-1/3 of the entire cost. This excludes other costs like insurance.  

In addition to that, the new measures imposed by the government for companies to start working include catered food, no lorries, swab tests would drive up the costs of operation significantly. Majority of the work being tendered are from the government, with companies giving a budget from the start pre-covid. I'm not sure if there will be amendments allowed to the budget for these projects but these companies are already operating at low margins since projects are usually given to the lowest tendered offer.

8568,"We should have locked down on the 18th of March, if you're going to imply that COVID-19 ""incubation"" period is 2 weeks. But that isn't going to help, since those 18th of March people could have infected family. So we should have locked down on the 4th of March.

There is bound to be people infected, no matter how early the lockdown is. And the real kicker? A lockdown wouldn't help if people have to go to NTUC to get food. Oh, food/grocery delivery service? Those guys could get it too. Not to mention ""essential"" services like buses and MRTs.

The only true lockdown is one that is water tight and that means not allowing people to even go out for groceries/cai png. You meet the cai png uncle, you give chance for cai png uncle to get it and spread to everyone who bought cai png that day. In fact, just like some of our social distancing rules (like malls limiting entry), they just push the source/cluster of infection somewhere else (in this case, grocery stores, public transport (cos not everyone is near grocery stores), delivery riders, food courts/hawkers).",0.02860000000000018,4/1/2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ft00p5/74_new_cases_of_covid19_infection_confirmed_20/fm4clpi/
