As for severity, the vaccine itself was created to mitigate the severity and symptom but it is also true that a healthy person who took care of thier body have natural antibody and defences against the virus. We’ve seen it as there were plenty of people whom got infected with covid but was asymptomatic and only require home quarantine and the virus died within them in matter of weeks.

8,"&gt; # Doctor whose Covid-19 home recovery post went viral didn't comply with rostered routine testing

&gt; SINGAPORE - A doctor whose account of his home recovery journey from Covid-19 went viral had failed to comply with the rostered routine testing that is mandatory for healthcare workers.

&gt; Dr Lai Kah Weng, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Island Orthopaedic Consultants at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, had recovered at home from Sept 28 to Oct 8 after developing a runny nose and mild fever on Sept 27.

&gt; His post on Facebook last Friday (Oct 8) was widely shared and The Straits Times also reported on it.

&gt; Island Orthopaedic Consultants is under the Healthway Medical group, and Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital is part of IHH Singapore's hospitals.

&gt; A Healthway Medical spokesman said on Monday (Oct 11) that it takes a very serious view of the matter and has convened a board of inquiry to investigate it.

&gt; After the story was published, three doctors contacted The Straits Times, saying that IHH Singapore has revoked Dr Lai's licence with the group due to his failure to comply with rostered routine testing (RRT) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for Covid-19.

&gt; This means Dr Lai cannot admit his patients toany of IHH's hospitals and is not allowed access to its facilities for surgery, for example.

&gt; A spokesman for IHH confirmed that the licence has been revoked at all four of its hospitals, but declined to give more details.

&gt; Confirming that the allegations were true, Dr Lai told The Straits Times that he had not gone for his RRT due to an ear, nose and throat medical condition which makes the nasopharyngeal swabs needed for PCR very painful and causes his nose to bleed.

&gt; He said he had gone for the first PCR swab when it was mandated for healthcare workers to do so. But he did not go for subsequent ones.

&gt; RRT takes place every two weeks for healthcare workers.

&gt; His failure to do so was discovered by the hospital after he tested positive for Covid-19 on Sept 28, Dr Lai added.

&gt; ""This is not an excuse for not doing the PCR test,"" he said.

&gt; ""What I should have done better was to inform the management about my condition so that they can put in place alternative Covid-19 test arrangements.""

&gt; He added that the fear and stigma of testing positive for Covid-19 contributed to his actions, and that this prompted him to speak about his home recovery journey on social media.

&gt; In the Facebook post, he had said that after developing symptoms on Sept 27, he isolated himself from his family and took an antigen rapid test (ART), which was negative.

&gt; When the flu-like symptoms persisted, he stayed home, then went to a neighbourhood GP, where an ART was positive and a PCR test confirmed the infection. His asymptomatic daughter's pre-emptive PCR swab came back positive.

&gt; He added in the post that he wanted to share his experience in the hope of destigmatising Covid-19 as a severe disease.

&gt; Dr Lai, who is vaccinated, said that when rules changed and healthcare workers had to take a self-administered ART, which must be supervised by trained staff, he booked his ART test but had become infected with Covid-19 before he could get his done.

&gt; Under the fast and easy testing regime, regular ART is done once every seven days.

&gt; Dr Lai is appealing against the revocation of his licence with IHH.

The math validating this daily is actually quite simple. For example, today 10 deaths of which 3 were fully vaccinated - given that 90% of each age group is vaccinated, a simple back of envelope calculation for today is (7/10)/(3/90) = 21X.

16,"""Younger adults admitted to hospital with Covid are almost as likely to suffer from complications as those over 50 years old, a study has found."" 

Yeah, people admitted to hospital, i.e. cases with complications. Obviously, those who have complications will have a higher chance of further issues. Let me offer a counter point then, since this article of yours references the pandemic in 2020. We had a massive outbreak in the worker dormitories in 2020, yet the vast majority of them simply stayed in their dorms and recovered normally. Most of the foreign workers would fall under the ""young and healthy"" demographic.

Your second article seems to run counter to our government's narrative that COVID is very low risk, given that even unvaccinated individuals under 50 are now told to simply recover at home if infected. So who is right?

Also, Oxford University has created a risk prediction algorithm which you can try out here: qcovid.org

Regarding the vaccine, I was referring more to the mRNA vaccines, sorry that I wasn't clear. The CDC website indicates that male adolescents and young adults have higher than average chances of encountering myocariditis when taking the mRNA vaccines. 

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/myocarditis.html

Yes, the Chinese vaccines use traditional methods, but it's made in China (lmao). Jokes aside, any new drug, whether made using new or traditional methods, needs to be tested properly before extensive use. In fact, a third of new drugs receive an alert, warning, or recall even after initial FDA approval, which is a shockingly high number.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-trouble-with-new-drugs-2019050216562

My stance is, and has always been, take the vaccine if you deem it necessary, but don't force and coerce others to do it. Let them come to their own conclusions, everybody has different circumstances that will affect their decision.",10/12/2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/q68jgf/in_response_to_anti_vaxxers_peitioning_about_not/hgbksjx/
17,"The article has been updated roughly some 3 hours after it was published. I copy out the edited article and quote it below. Use a [text compare tool](https://text-compare.com/) to see the before/after.

&gt; SINGAPORE - A family physician at a clinic in MacPherson who died from Covid-19 over the weekend has been remembered as a kind, caring doctor who deliberately kept his charges low to help the needy in the area.

&gt; A message circulating on social media on Monday (Oct 11), as well as among various doctors here, said that Dr Raymond Yuen of Hosanna Medical Centre died in Tan Tock Seng Hospital after battling the virus.

&gt; Asked about the message, the Health Ministry (MOH) said on Monday night that Dr Yuen, 65, had died from Covid-19 on Oct 9. Expressing its condolences to Dr Yuen's family, MOH added that there is no evidence he was infected by a Covid-19 patient.

&gt; Local media outlet 8world had reported a clinic staff member as saying that Dr Yuen could have caught the virus from a patient.

&gt; MOH said that Dr Yuen's clinic is neither a Public Health Preparedness Clinic nor a Swab-and-Send-Home Clinic, and that there are no records of his clinic seeing any Covid-19 patients recently.

&gt; It added that Dr Yuen had been  partially vaccinated against Covid-19 with a non-mRNA vaccine, and had no known medical conditions.

&gt; Calls The Straits Times made to the clinic throughout the day went unanswered, but ST understands that Dr Yuen's wake took place on Sunday.

&gt; Dr Yuen, who was born in Hong Kong but later became a citizen here, graduated from the University of Hong Kong in 1987, and arrived in Singapore in 1990. He got his Master of Medicine from the National University of Singapore in 1992.

&gt; Dr Lee Pheng Soon, a general practitioner who worked with Dr Yuen at a clinic in the early 1990s, told ST that Dr Yuen was a ""soft-spoken but very friendly person"".

&gt; He recalled: ""He would go out of his way to help people who needed anything extra. He used to give lots of extra time to patients who were concerned, or who did not understand their illnesses, or who just needed the extra attention.

&gt; ""It's no exaggeration to say some of his patients loved him for his kindness. Many years after he left the clinic... patients would still ask after him, and request we relay their best wishes.""

&gt; ""He would reach out to people who needed help, and go all out to help them,"" added Dr Lee.

&gt; On Monday morning, MacPherson MP Tin Pei Ling put up a Facebook post about a caring GP in the area who had died.

&gt; She wrote: ""I learnt about the great things he had done for our community in MacPherson from residents who used to see him at his clinic.

&gt; ""They shared about how the affable doctor made visits to the clinic less intimidating. They enjoyed the small talk and tips on leading a healthy and holistic lifestyle, which he was so passionate about. Residents knew that he did so out of sincerity and care for their well-being. Many of his patients became friends with him.""

&gt; Adding that she was ""deeply saddened"" by the news, she noted that Dr Yuen had kept consultation charges low so that the more vulnerable residents would be encouraged to seek medical care.

&gt; ""Many of us are moved by his benevolence to the community. Our thoughts are with his family. I sincerely hope that the family will find the strength to overcome the grief,"" she said.

&gt; Dr Yuen was also in the news in 2005 for his generosity to his foreign maid at the time.

&gt; He had gone the extra mile to care for her, such as paying for one year's house rent for her family in Sri Lanka, and flying her daughter to Singapore after her house and school were destroyed in the 2004 tsunami.

&gt; Not only did he pay for her flight and put her up in his home, but he also enrolled the girl in school here, and helped to pay for her school fees from time to time.

&gt; Speaking to ST at the time, Dr Yuen said: ""I think I did very little... Maids have needs and emotions too, and they need privacy like any other human being.""

&gt; An online memorial for Dr Yuen was uploaded on YouTube on Sunday.

&gt; In it, his younger brother, speaking in Cantonese, said: “My brother Raymond was an optimistic person who was always willing to lend a helping hand.

&gt; “No matter what he did, he did it with determination and resolve.... He loved God, and also loved his family.”

&gt; He added: “As your family, we are extremely shocked by your sudden passing, and we miss you deeply. We know we will all meet again in heaven. Till then, shalom (a religious greeting meaning peace).”",10/12/2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/q5v3uw/macpherson_doctor_who_had_covid19_and_died_was/hg9rs3l/

&gt; The virus infect regardless you are vec or not so I don’t understand exactly what you mean by likelyhood? Are you saying the virus can detect between a vac and unvac person?

The probability of you getting infected is lower if you are vaccinated (or have recovered from a past infection), because you have antibodies that may be able to clear the virus before it manages to really infect you.

&gt; it is also true that a healthy person who took care of thier body have natural antibody

Unless you have contracted COVID-19 or have been vaccinated, you are unlikely to have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. So this is false.

&gt; defences against the virus

These take a longer time to get to work, and this allows a more severe infection to take root.

&gt; We’ve seen it as there were plenty of people whom got infected with covid but was asymptomatic and only require home quarantine and the virus died within them in matter of weeks.

The likelihood of symptomatic infection and severe disease is higher if you are not vaccinated.
