8,"&gt; # Doctor whose Covid-19 home recovery post went viral didn't comply with rostered routine testing

&gt; SINGAPORE - A doctor whose account of his home recovery journey from Covid-19 went viral had failed to comply with the rostered routine testing that is mandatory for healthcare workers.

&gt; Dr Lai Kah Weng, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Island Orthopaedic Consultants at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, had recovered at home from Sept 28 to Oct 8 after developing a runny nose and mild fever on Sept 27.

&gt; His post on Facebook last Friday (Oct 8) was widely shared and The Straits Times also reported on it.

&gt; Island Orthopaedic Consultants is under the Healthway Medical group, and Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital is part of IHH Singapore's hospitals.

&gt; A Healthway Medical spokesman said on Monday (Oct 11) that it takes a very serious view of the matter and has convened a board of inquiry to investigate it.

&gt; After the story was published, three doctors contacted The Straits Times, saying that IHH Singapore has revoked Dr Lai's licence with the group due to his failure to comply with rostered routine testing (RRT) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for Covid-19.

&gt; This means Dr Lai cannot admit his patients toany of IHH's hospitals and is not allowed access to its facilities for surgery, for example.

&gt; A spokesman for IHH confirmed that the licence has been revoked at all four of its hospitals, but declined to give more details.

&gt; Confirming that the allegations were true, Dr Lai told The Straits Times that he had not gone for his RRT due to an ear, nose and throat medical condition which makes the nasopharyngeal swabs needed for PCR very painful and causes his nose to bleed.

&gt; He said he had gone for the first PCR swab when it was mandated for healthcare workers to do so. But he did not go for subsequent ones.

&gt; RRT takes place every two weeks for healthcare workers.

&gt; His failure to do so was discovered by the hospital after he tested positive for Covid-19 on Sept 28, Dr Lai added.

&gt; ""This is not an excuse for not doing the PCR test,"" he said.

&gt; ""What I should have done better was to inform the management about my condition so that they can put in place alternative Covid-19 test arrangements.""

&gt; He added that the fear and stigma of testing positive for Covid-19 contributed to his actions, and that this prompted him to speak about his home recovery journey on social media.

&gt; In the Facebook post, he had said that after developing symptoms on Sept 27, he isolated himself from his family and took an antigen rapid test (ART), which was negative.

&gt; When the flu-like symptoms persisted, he stayed home, then went to a neighbourhood GP, where an ART was positive and a PCR test confirmed the infection. His asymptomatic daughter's pre-emptive PCR swab came back positive.

&gt; He added in the post that he wanted to share his experience in the hope of destigmatising Covid-19 as a severe disease.

&gt; Dr Lai, who is vaccinated, said that when rules changed and healthcare workers had to take a self-administered ART, which must be supervised by trained staff, he booked his ART test but had become infected with Covid-19 before he could get his done.

&gt; Under the fast and easy testing regime, regular ART is done once every seven days.

&gt; Dr Lai is appealing against the revocation of his licence with IHH.

Yeah, people admitted to hospital, i.e. cases with complications. Obviously, those who have complications will have a higher chance of further issues. Let me offer a counter point then, since this article of yours references the pandemic in 2020. We had a massive outbreak in the worker dormitories in 2020, yet the vast majority of them simply stayed in their dorms and recovered normally. Most of the foreign workers would fall under the ""young and healthy"" demographic.

Your second article seems to run counter to our government's narrative that COVID is very low risk, given that even unvaccinated individuals under 50 are now told to simply recover at home if infected. So who is right?

Also, Oxford University has created a risk prediction algorithm which you can try out here: qcovid.org

Regarding the vaccine, I was referring more to the mRNA vaccines, sorry that I wasn't clear. The CDC website indicates that male adolescents and young adults have higher than average chances of encountering myocariditis when taking the mRNA vaccines. 

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/myocarditis.html

Yes, the Chinese vaccines use traditional methods, but it's made in China (lmao). Jokes aside, any new drug, whether made using new or traditional methods, needs to be tested properly before extensive use. In fact, a third of new drugs receive an alert, warning, or recall even after initial FDA approval, which is a shockingly high number.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-trouble-with-new-drugs-2019050216562

My stance is, and has always been, take the vaccine if you deem it necessary, but don't force and coerce others to do it. Let them come to their own conclusions, everybody has different circumstances that will affect their decision.",10/12/2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/q68jgf/in_response_to_anti_vaxxers_peitioning_about_not/hgbksjx/

&gt; SINGAPORE - A family physician at a clinic in MacPherson who died from Covid-19 over the weekend has been remembered as a kind, caring doctor who deliberately kept his charges low to help the needy in the area.

&gt; A message circulating on social media on Monday (Oct 11), as well as among various doctors here, said that Dr Raymond Yuen of Hosanna Medical Centre died in Tan Tock Seng Hospital after battling the virus.

&gt; Asked about the message, the Health Ministry (MOH) said on Monday night that Dr Yuen, 65, had died from Covid-19 on Oct 9. Expressing its condolences to Dr Yuen's family, MOH added that there is no evidence he was infected by a Covid-19 patient.

&gt; Local media outlet 8world had reported a clinic staff member as saying that Dr Yuen could have caught the virus from a patient.

&gt; MOH said that Dr Yuen's clinic is neither a Public Health Preparedness Clinic nor a Swab-and-Send-Home Clinic, and that there are no records of his clinic seeing any Covid-19 patients recently.

&gt; It added that Dr Yuen had been  partially vaccinated against Covid-19 with a non-mRNA vaccine, and had no known medical conditions.

&gt; Calls The Straits Times made to the clinic throughout the day went unanswered, but ST understands that Dr Yuen's wake took place on Sunday.

&gt; Dr Yuen, who was born in Hong Kong but later became a citizen here, graduated from the University of Hong Kong in 1987, and arrived in Singapore in 1990. He got his Master of Medicine from the National University of Singapore in 1992.

&gt; Dr Lee Pheng Soon, a general practitioner who worked with Dr Yuen at a clinic in the early 1990s, told ST that Dr Yuen was a ""soft-spoken but very friendly person"".

&gt; He recalled: ""He would go out of his way to help people who needed anything extra. He used to give lots of extra time to patients who were concerned, or who did not understand their illnesses, or who just needed the extra attention.

&gt; ""It's no exaggeration to say some of his patients loved him for his kindness. Many years after he left the clinic... patients would still ask after him, and request we relay their best wishes.""

&gt; ""He would reach out to people who needed help, and go all out to help them,"" added Dr Lee.

&gt; On Monday morning, MacPherson MP Tin Pei Ling put up a Facebook post about a caring GP in the area who had died.

&gt; She wrote: ""I learnt about the great things he had done for our community in MacPherson from residents who used to see him at his clinic.

&gt; ""They shared about how the affable doctor made visits to the clinic less intimidating. They enjoyed the small talk and tips on leading a healthy and holistic lifestyle, which he was so passionate about. Residents knew that he did so out of sincerity and care for their well-being. Many of his patients became friends with him.""

&gt; Adding that she was ""deeply saddened"" by the news, she noted that Dr Yuen had kept consultation charges low so that the more vulnerable residents would be encouraged to seek medical care.

&gt; ""Many of us are moved by his benevolence to the community. Our thoughts are with his family. I sincerely hope that the family will find the strength to overcome the grief,"" she said.

&gt; Dr Yuen was also in the news in 2005 for his generosity to his foreign maid at the time.

&gt; He had gone the extra mile to care for her, such as paying for one year's house rent for her family in Sri Lanka, and flying her daughter to Singapore after her house and school were destroyed in the 2004 tsunami.

&gt; Not only did he pay for her flight and put her up in his home, but he also enrolled the girl in school here, and helped to pay for her school fees from time to time.

&gt; Speaking to ST at the time, Dr Yuen said: ""I think I did very little... Maids have needs and emotions too, and they need privacy like any other human being.""

&gt; An online memorial for Dr Yuen was uploaded on YouTube on Sunday.

&gt; In it, his younger brother, speaking in Cantonese, said: “My brother Raymond was an optimistic person who was always willing to lend a helping hand.

&gt; “No matter what he did, he did it with determination and resolve.... He loved God, and also loved his family.”

&gt; He added: “As your family, we are extremely shocked by your sudden passing, and we miss you deeply. We know we will all meet again in heaven. Till then, shalom (a religious greeting meaning peace).”",10/12/2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/q5v3uw/macpherson_doctor_who_had_covid19_and_died_was/hg9rs3l/

&gt; The virus infect regardless you are vec or not so I don’t understand exactly what you mean by likelyhood? Are you saying the virus can detect between a vac and unvac person?

The probability of you getting infected is lower if you are vaccinated (or have recovered from a past infection), because you have antibodies that may be able to clear the virus before it manages to really infect you.

&gt; it is also true that a healthy person who took care of thier body have natural antibody

Unless you have contracted COVID-19 or have been vaccinated, you are unlikely to have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. So this is false.

&gt; defences against the virus

These take a longer time to get to work, and this allows a more severe infection to take root.

26,"&gt; # Unvaxxed persons can enter malls for medical appointments, Ong Ye Kung &amp; Lawrence Wong clarify

&gt; On Oct. 9, the Multi-ministry Taskforce (MTF) announced new Covid-19 vaccination-differentiated safe management measures (VDS) in Singapore.

&gt; From Oct. 13, unvaccinated individuals are not allowed to enter malls or dine in at hawker centres and coffeeshops.

&gt; However, they are allowed to enter these venues to order food for takeout, MTF co-chair Minister Lawrence Wong said.

&gt; FAQs on VDS

&gt; In a video posted on their Facebook pages on Oct. 12, Wong and Health Minister Ong Ye Kung addressed other common queries relating to the new VDS.

&gt; ""Why are there tightened measures against the unvaccinated persons?""

&gt; Wong explained that the government is looking out for the unvaccinated in Singapore as ""the risks are higher"".

&gt; He added that the measures have been put in place to ""safeguard the health and well-being"" of these unvaccinated persons.

&gt; Wong said: ""We have just 1.5 per cent of people who are unvaccinated, but they make up two-thirds of the people in intensive care units (ICU), or who have passed away.""

&gt; Ong then added: ""Even if you are young but unvaccinated, don’t take for granted that you are safe.""

&gt; ""If I'm unvaccinated, can I go for my medical appointment in a mall?""

&gt; According to Wong, unvaccinated individuals who need to enter a mall to go to a general practitioner (GP) or dental clinic for medical treatment are allowed to do so.

&gt; ""If I'm unvaccinated, can I bring my kids to childcare centres in a mall?""

&gt; Unvaccinated individuals can also enter malls to send their children to childcare services.

&gt; Wong added that children under 12 are already currently exempted from the VDS, and this will continue when the new measures kick in.

&gt; ""If I'm unvaccinated, can I still go for staycations?""

&gt; Unvaccinated individuals can still go for staycations in hotels, said Wong.

&gt; However, they may not be able to enter a restaurant in the hotel.

&gt; ""Will standalone supermarkets be a haven for the unvaccinated?""

&gt; There will be places, such as standalone markets and supermarkets, that unvaccinated individuals can go to to run their errands.

&gt; ""We can't stop that,"" Wong said.

&gt; But he added:

&gt; ""We appeal to everyone who is unvaccinated. You know the risks are higher when you are not vaccinated. So please take the necessary precautions.""

&gt; ""How can we enforce VDS in coffeeshops and hawker centres?""

&gt; For hawker centres and coffeeshops in Singapore, Wong said the government is relying on the operators to ""see how best they can implement this new measure"".

&gt; However, Wong added that the government will conduct spot checks.

&gt; ""How can we prevent transmission on public transport?""

&gt; To prevent transmission on public transports, Ong said that ventilation is critical.

&gt; He added:

&gt; ""Both buses, MRTs, and for that matter, planes, have very good ventilation. But it's also important to do our part. Don't chit chat and put down our masks. You can keep public transport very safe.""

&gt; ""How will the VDS protect the elderly?""

&gt; Data have shown that most of the Covid-19 cases in recent weeks have visited shopping malls, hawker centres, and coffeeshops, Wong said.

&gt; ""That's why we've extended the vaccination-differentiated measures to these settings,"" he added.

&gt; Other FAQs

&gt; Both Ong and Wong also answered questions relating to the new health protocols, border measures, and vaccines.

&gt;On the other hand, peaking at 4-8 weeks from the start of this wave (Aug 23), seems much more unlikely and now looks to be somewhat wishful thinking. It may be possible if we can restrict the ""epidemic size"" to 0.05. Despite the experience of other countries, we don't seem to be following the script of peaking at around 2 months.  
  
My conjecture is that Singapore's unique circumstance of being ""COVID naive"", having a very high vaccination rate and relatively stringent restrictions, leads to a ""slow burn"": a long lasting but not ""explosive"" exit wave lasting 3-6 months. As the G says, ""no big bang"". Regardless, 10k cases a day looks daunting given that 1.2% require further medical attention. One would hope that the MTF is planning ahead for that eventuality, which may come in mid-Nov.

I maintain that SG is in uncharted waters and no one knows what will happen, because we are one of the few covid-naive countries around and as of now, the only one that opened up and hence the furthest one along the epidemic curve.

We see what happens to Australia in time, Sydney lifted restrictions yesterday.

IMO the only thing that worries the government now would be the healthcare system. If they assume this peak can be over in 3 - 6 months, probably SAF can continue to help tank.

&gt; SINGAPORE - Unvaccinated people can continue to enter shopping malls for their medical appointments, such as to make visits to general practitioner clinics or to see the dentist even after vaccination-differentiated measures kick in.

&gt; These were one of the questions answered by the co-chairs of Singapore’s multi-ministry task force in a video put up on Facebook on Tuesday (Oct 12).

&gt; The video touched on a range of topics, from explaining why people who are eligible should get their booster jabs to why it is necessary to tighten measures even as Singaporeans are told that they need not fear Covid-19.

&gt; On Oct 10, the multi-ministry task force (MTF) tackling Covid-19 announced that unvaccinated people will no longer be allowed to dine in or enter malls and large standalone stores. Large standalone supermarkets will be exempted from these measures.

&gt; A week’s grace period from Oct 13 to 19 was given for mall operators and others to become familiar with these measures.

&gt; In the video which runs for about six minutes, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong also explain why there are tighter measures for those who are not vaccinated.

&gt; Mr Wong said: “We are looking out for these unvaccinated people because the risks are higher... We have just 1.5 per cent of people who are unvaccinated, but they make up two-thirds of the people in intensive care units or who have passed away.”

&gt; Mr Ong added: “Even if you are young but unvaccinated, don’t take for granted that you are safe.”

&gt; Another question raised was whether parents or caregivers who are unvaccinated will be able to take their children to childcare centres located in malls.

&gt; “Again, we will provide flexibility for such cases,” Mr Wong said.

&gt; When asked how the task force plans to enforce vaccination-differentiated measures in coffee shops and hawker centres, Mr Wong said they will be rely on coffee shop operators to implement this new measure, and that spot checks will be done by the Government.

&gt; “All of us must do our part, we must exercise responsibility,” Mr Wong stressed.

One study observed that Delta infection in fully vaccinated persons was associated with significantly less transmission to contacts than persons who were unvaccinated or partially vaccinated.(181)

Together, these studies suggest that vaccinated people who become infected with Delta have potential to be less infectious than infected unvaccinated people. However, more data are needed to understand how viral shedding and transmission from fully vaccinated persons are affected by SARS-CoV-2 variants, time since vaccination, and other factors, particularly as transmission dynamics may vary based on the extent of exposure to the infected vaccinated person and the setting in which the exposure occurs. Additional data collection and studies are underway to understand the extent and duration of transmissibility of Delta variant SARS-CoV-2 in the United States and other countries.

You are right that long-COVID is also largely unknown, but as the vaccine does not actually prevent you from contracting COVID, it may only have a limited effect in preventing long-COVID, in addition to also introducing the risk of long term vaccine side effects. 

Any disease is potentially deadly if you are vulnerable enough. You agreed that unvaccinated young people have a very low chance of getting severe complications from COVID, ergo, it can hardly be considered deadly for such a demographic.

1. I read this article two years ago and am willing to admit I did not recall exactly what she claimed. Read the paper yourself if you have so much distrust.

2. So instead of claiming that authoritarian measure *in China* were not to attributed to arresting the Pandemics growth, she talks about athoritarian measures *in general*

How is this drastically different from what I wrote?

In fact it broadens the scope of her claims / statement which makes it *worse*?

&gt;incidentally, at least half the world's scientists and politicians were wrong about almost every thing covid-related.

The fact that you can make this statement means you do not understand how scientific consensus is achieved and how science works in general.

Science is not about *absolute truth* its about *objective truth*.

Furthermore what scientists were near unanimous about the fact that lock downs were needed to stop the spread of the Pandemic or at least reduce the number of deaths.

The Imperial college itself published a study citing thst Boris Johnson's plan to achieve herd immunity and not implement more harsh measures would have led to the deaths of at least a million people in the U.K.

55,"your first point makes no sense 

you said ' However, the chance of COVID complications in young and healthy people (even unvaxxed) is basically nil' 

and then you're acknowledging 'Yeah, people admitted to hospital, i.e. cases with complications. Obviously, those who have complications will have a higher chance of further issues.' 

understand your point about the dorm workers, but again, the scope of the outbreak in Singapore v other countries is no comparable, i.e the sample size is too small. The simple fact is if more young people got infected, more would have then developed complications.

If your point is ' the chance of severe COVID complications  occurring in young and healthy people people in Singapore is very low' , I would accept that 

&gt; Your second article seems to run counter to our government's narrative that COVID is very low risk, given that even unvaccinated individuals under 50 are now told to simply recover at home if infected. So who is right? No comment 

My point is that the unvaccinated are a danger to themselves, and should be cordoned off. No comment on the other Clownish actions of the MMTF. 

&gt; Regarding the vaccine, I was referring more to the mRNA vaccines, sorry that I wasn't clear.

Yeah, you can still take the non-mRNA vaccine and be consider 'vaccinated' and be allowed into malls 

Noted your points on the china vaccines, hence why the its not on the PSAR list, but as another person pointed out, similar to the unknown risks of the mRNA vaccines, the long term s/e of Covid is not known as well

The term ""anti-vax"" doesn't really help as it just puts everyone together in one group. People can choose not to take the COVID-19 vaccine for a whole number of reasons.

Sure maybe there are people who believe in some conspiracy theories that are more towards the extreme end, but many also have more moderate doubts. It's not either or. Perhaps the doubts combined with personal circumstances are enough to favour the decision to abstain from vaccination.

I am always amused by how people have absolute faith in what they believe is right and that others must then be wrong if they do not agree.

If anything, when so much of what we know or think we know is influenced by our sources of information, we must question these sources and figure it out for ourselves, or allow for the possibility that information is not always accurate or that they should be evaluated in light of the interests of those who control access to information.

However, the chance of COVID complications in young and healthy people (even unvaxxed) is basically nil, making it illogical to coerce them into taking the vaccine. Their natural immunity will, in the vast vast majority of cases, defeat the virus and build a far stronger and longer lasting immunity compared to the vaccines.

85,"&gt; # Hong Kong risks global status as Singapore opens up to world

&gt; By Iain Marlow and Shirley Zhao

&gt; (Bloomberg) —The divide between Asia’s two main financial hubs in handling the pandemic is growing ever wider, with one opening up to global travel and the other maintaining one of the world’s harshest quarantine policies.

&gt; In Singapore, officials are taking steps to reconnect with the global economy even as the government faces pressure to favour locals over foreigners for well-paying jobs. Speaking in a televised address over the weekend, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that Singapore can’t stay “locked down and closed off indefinitely” and residents should prepare to see “many Covid-19 cases for some time to come.”

&gt; Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has taken the opposite approach, stressing in a Bloomberg Television interview Monday that even a single death would be a “major concern” as she follows China’s Covid Zero approach that tolerates no local infections. While expressing concern about the city’s reputation, Lam said she was “duty bound to protect my people” and businesses in any case saw Hong Kong as a gateway to the mainland.

&gt; The divergence is raising questions about Hong Kong’s future as a regional hub, particularly among an expat business community that for years has bounced back-and-forth between the former British colonies known for low tax rates, friendly labor laws and easy immigration policies. Even fully vaccinated residents in Hong Kong face a mandatory 21-day hotel stay if they visit locations like the U.S. and U.K., while Singapore is starting to allow quarantine-free travel to those places and more.

&gt; A Facebook post on Saturday captured the ennui many are feeling in Hong Kong. In a group with 55,000 members to support those stuck in quarantine, one member wrote that the city’s restaurants, bars, beaches and hiking trails were getting monotonous, and many residents who see life returning to normal in Europe or the U.S. often don’t want to come back.

&gt; “I was born here and have lived in this beautiful city for 36 years, but I can’t go on anymore. I can’t take it,” the person wrote in the post, which had more than 1,000 likes and nearly 500 comments as of Monday afternoon. “The thing is if there was any semblance of hope — on X date we will open up — then the atmosphere here would be buzzing. But the feeling is there is no hope or end in sight.”

&gt; Hong Kong’s strict travel policies show just how much its leaders are keen to impress Beijing, which has moved to eliminate dissent following sometimes-violent pro-democracy protests in 2019. But quarantines are required even for travel to the mainland and there’s no clear criteria for easing restrictions, leaving the business community with nowhere to go that doesn’t involve a lengthy time locked in a hotel room.

&gt; Danny Lau, who runs a factory in Guangdong province across the China border that manufactures construction materials mostly for U.S. clients, said “Hong Kong could easily be taken over by Singapore” as Asia’s international financial hub if it continues with its Covid Zero policy.

&gt; “We of course welcome the Singapore model because it’s very difficult to eradicate Covid,” said Lau, who serves as honorary chairman of the Hong Kong Small and Medium Enterprises Association. “There may still be cases after five years. Are you going to close the border for five years?”

&gt; Lam and other Hong Kong officials say the policies are popular with the public and have worked in suppressing the virus: The city has seen less than 12,300 cases and only 213 deaths throughout the entire pandemic. Disputing accusations that Hong Kong can’t autonomously set policy, Lam said Monday the city was doing “very well” as a financial center. Last week she said the mainland was “more important” than international business.

&gt; But the travel policies are adding to concerns for businesses in Hong Kong, which were already facing a China-backed clampdown on free speech, questions about the independence of the judiciary and an education system now focused on patriotism.

&gt; Hong Kong saw a record outflow of 89,200 residents in the year that ended in June, while the latest annual government survey showed the number of U.S.-based firms in the city fell for a third straight year to 1,267 — down 6.2% from 2018. And while the overall number of companies with foreign parents has risen to a record of 9,049 this year — a statistic Lam cited on Monday as a sign of the city’s competitiveness — data show the increases have come mostly from China.

&gt; In one survey, the American Chamber of Commerce said more than 40% of its members were considering leaving the city. Amcham’s president, Tara Joseph, told Bloomberg News last week that lobbying the Hong Kong government to reopen was like “talking to a wall.”

&gt; “We’re looking toward the second Christmas in a row when not many families will be traveling home, and that doesn’t help the overall confidence of decision makers in Hong Kong,” said Frederik Gollob, chairman of the European Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. He said many companies were discussing measures short of moving their businesses, including relocating people to the mainland or moving certain jobs to other places like Singapore.

&gt; That may not be so easy. Singapore has toughened up its immigration policies, increasing scrutiny of banks, fund managers, management consultancies and other firms suspected of “discriminatory hiring practices” that pass over locals for foreigners. In August, Prime Minister Lee pledged to tighten restrictions on foreign workers and raise wages for low-income labourers as the city-state recovers from a pandemic-induced recession.

&gt; Singapore has also seen its population drop for a second consecutive year, primarily due to an exodus of foreign workers, students and residents amid tight Covid controls.

&gt; Still, the Hong Kong business community is worried. Felix Chung, a pro-establishment lawmaker who represents the textile industry in the Legislative Council, said Hong Kong “cannot disconnect with the rest of the world” if it’s going to be an international financial center.

&gt; “Singapore, as a rival to Hong Kong, will definitely take the chance to grab as many of our businesses as possible,” he said. “It’s a threat to Hong Kong.”

87,"&gt; # Commentary: Delta variant makes COVID-19 border closures unsustainable in Southeast Asia

&gt; SINGAPORE: The Delta variant of the coronavirus has become or is fast becoming the dominant variant in Southeast Asian countries. It is already dominant in countries that were successful in containing the spread of earlier strains and rapidly catching up in those that were not.

&gt; The high transmissibility of the Delta variant should force a rethink on the methods used in combating its spread in the community. As it becomes dominant, it calls into question the current combination of mobility restrictions at and within borders.

&gt; In particular, its high transmissibility is eroding the health protective effects of border closures relative to domestic mobility restrictions, while the economic cost of the former continues to rise with time.

&gt; A recalibration in Southeast Asia, as seen in Europe and North America, is overdue.

&gt; After more than a year and a half since borders were first closed around the world, Southeast Asia remains mostly closed to non-essential travel, unlike in Europe or North America.

&gt; A lot of this has to do with the lower vaccination rates in the region. Reaching herd immunity through vaccination may be required before allowing quarantine-free travel for the vaccinated because they still carry some risk of infection, but a much lower risk of developing severe symptoms.

&gt; Therefore, opening up to vaccinated travellers reduces the risk of them adding strains to already-challenged healthcare systems while achieving herd immunity protects the local community.

90,"&gt; # Singapore hospitals find new ways to cope amid wave of Covid-19 cases

&gt; SINGAPORE - As public hospitals here grapple with the surge in Covid-19 patients, two of them have new initiatives to ensure their emergency departments (ED) can cater to patients with urgent needs as much as possible.

&gt; The programmes are aimed at preventing unnecessary ED visits by those who need help but do not have Covid-19 or urgent issues.

&gt; Alexandra Hospital (AH) has a new hotline for discharged patients while Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (NTFGH) has a new ED care management scheme.

&gt; Piloted around August last year, the schemes target frail, elderly persons who frequently visit their EDs. The goal is to decongest the EDs and save beds.

&gt; EDs have always been crowded, but the pandemic has made the situation much worse, particularly now. As at Monday (Oct 11), 1,698 Covid-19 patients are warded in various hospitals, with 308 needing oxygen supplementation and 42 in intensive care.

&gt; To free up hospital capacity, hospitals have, for instance, postponed less urgent surgeries and are actively discharging patients or shortening stays when possible.

&gt; AH's hotline is for discharged patients to call, send an SMS or e-mail for help with post-discharge medical matters, instead of returning to its ED, which is called a 24-hour Urgent Care Centre or UCC, as it handles medical emergencies but not major trauma cases like heart attack or acute stroke.

&gt; Care managers manning the hotline in the Virtual Care Centre are from the existing transitional care team that also helps with coordinating community services for patients ready to be discharged. They get about 50 calls a month on average.

&gt; With the new centre, discharged patients can gain access to a doctor, or be directly re-admitted to a ward, thus bypassing the UCC.

&gt; ""Having access to a doctor after discharge and being able to admit patients directly from home to the hospital ward is a totally new initiative,"" said Dr Satya Gollamudi, AH's head of medical services who leads the virtual centre.

&gt; The aim is to prevent unnecessary readmissions to the hospital's UCC, he said.

&gt; The scheme has helped AH prevent 37 per cent of readmissions from August last year to September this year, said Dr Gollamudi.

&gt; ""These are the cases that, if we don't intervene, would have gone back to the ED,"" he said.

&gt; This is because these elderly patients - more than 80 per cent of AH's inpatients are above the age of 65 - would do so to get help for problems they develop a few days or weeks after discharge.

&gt; ""Until now, most admissions happen through emergency departments. There is no other way to admit to inpatient wards,"" said Dr Gollamudi.

&gt; NTFGH now has an ED case manager under a new programme started by emergency medicine consultant Dr Colin Ong. It gives seniors (who do not have Covid-19 or an emergency) access to the care they need such as speech therapy, without having to be admitted.

&gt; These are the frail, elderly patients who go to the ED for various reasons such as a mild infection, or they may have had a fall but do not have a fracture that needs to be fixed, or a medical condition that caused the fall, said Dr Ong.

&gt; He added that the new programme has helped prevent 30 per cent of readmissions from August last year to June this year.

&gt; Intervening at the ED stage is a win-win situation because elderly patients generally do not do well when hospitalised, said Dr Ong.

&gt; ""They may decline physically and mentally while being warded. This helps to reduce the falls and infections, and we save a bed,"" he said.

&gt; The case manager, Assistant Nurse Clinician Kamala Velu, can link these patients at the ED directly to allied health professionals and community service providers, or arrange for home care, among other things.

&gt; She said she has arranged for medical transport, meal delivery, community nursing and social support for a patient with low vision who would otherwise be frequently admitted to hospital.

&gt; Dr Ong and Ms Kamala have experience in this area, having made home visits some years ago to patients discharged from the ED. That programme was dropped because it proved too costly.

&gt; The NTFGH ED care management team, which has trained a group of doctors and nurses to help with the screening process, currently has one case manager and continues to look for more.

&gt; AH is also planning to grow its virtual care centre and extend the current 9am to 5.30pm Mon-Fri operating hours of the hotline to 9pm next year. There are also plans to exte nd this service to patients at outpatient clinics, the community in the Queenstown area and later in the western region.

&gt; ""We want to cast a wider net to avoid unnecessary ED visits. That's the whole point of this programme,"" said Dr Gollamudi.

92,"&gt; # Unvaccinated kids aged 12 &amp; below can travel under Vaccinated Travel Lanes if certain conditions met

&gt; Families with kids might want to start planning for a trip abroad soon.

&gt; On Oct. 11, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) announced that children under the age of 12 who are unvaccinated will be allowed to travel with their families if accompanied by a Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTL) traveller.

&gt; More Vaccinated Travel Lanes opened up

&gt; On Oct. 9, the authorities announced the addition of more VTLs to the earlier ones of Germany and Brunei.

&gt; From Oct. 19, the additional VTL countries are:

&gt; U.S.

&gt; UK

&gt; Canada

&gt; France

&gt; Italy

&gt; Spain

&gt; The Netherlands

&gt; Denmark

&gt; From Nov. 15 onwards, South Korea is also included.

&gt; VTL requirements

&gt; According to CAAS:

&gt; ""Children aged 12 years and below, including short-term visitors, long-term pass holders, Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents, will qualify for travel under the VTL without the need to show proof of vaccination. The age of the child will be based on the calendar year. For example, a child born in or after 2009 will be allowed to enter Singapore under the VTL in 2021. The child must be accompanied by a VTL traveller who meets all VTL requirements for entry into Singapore. The child does not need to apply for a Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP) to travel to Singapore under the VTL.""

&gt; However, travellers are strongly encouraged to check the requirements of the countries they are travelling to.

&gt; For example, right now Brunei Darussalam does not allow general travel into the country.

&gt; From Nov. 15, 2021, South Korea will allow general travel into the country under the VTL but this does not include children who do not qualify for vaccination or persons who are medically unfit to be vaccinated.

&gt; More requirements

&gt; In addition, they must adhere to the following requirements:

&gt; Stay in VTL countries

&gt; The child must have remained in one or more of the list of VTL countries in the last 14 consecutive days prior to departure to Singapore.

&gt; If the child has been in Singapore within those last 14 days, their stay in Singapore can be counted towards fulfilling this 14-day travel history requirement.

&gt; The child who is travelling to Singapore under the VTL must travel into Singapore on designated VTL flights.

&gt; The child who is transferring or transiting through Singapore will also be allowed to travel on the designated VTL flights.

&gt; The child, except those aged two years and below, will also be required to take a pre-departure PCR test within 48 hours before departing to Singapore.

&gt; Testing

&gt; Children above the age of two must take two Covid-19 PCR tests:

&gt; A pre-departure test within 48 hours before departing to Singapore and obtain a negative test result.

&gt; An on-arrival test at Changi Airport and remain self-isolated until their test result is confirmed negative.

&gt; Information on the requirements may be found at this website.

&gt; Disappointed parents

&gt; Following the announcement of the expanded VTLs, but prior to the CAAS announcement of the provisions for children, some parents expressed disappointment at not being able to fly with their children.

&gt; The Straits Times interviewed a woman who was rather vexed at having her holiday plans not quite fitting in with the rules then.

&gt; One woman known as Chua unburdened herself thus:

&gt; ""...because of the rules, she is now deciding whether to leave her daughter at home to travel with her 45-year-old husband on a VTL-designated flight, or to take a non-VTL flight for all three, which means a stay-home notice on their return. Ms Chua is frustrated that rules on travel continue to be tight when others have been relaxed, such as the allowing of children aged five to 11 to be placed on home recovery. She added: ""If parents are fine with taking the risk, then we should be given a choice. This is a very difficult position to be in.""""

108,"&gt; # Some elderly S'poreans stopping at two doses, or refusing Covid-19 vaccine altogether

&gt; SINGAPORE - Living with a younger sister who has decided against vaccination has been frustrating for Mr Lim King Joo, 70.

&gt; Mr Lim, who is waiting to receive his booster shot next month, having completed the first two rounds in early May, said his 65-year-old sister has not received a single dose of the vaccine.

&gt; ""She refuses to go and I can't convince her. She says she's afraid of the side effects,"" he said, adding that his three other siblings have also tried talking to her but to no avail.

&gt; Mr Lim, who is a divorcee, shares a flat in Bedok Reservoir with his unmarried sister.

&gt; The former financial consultant shared that these disagreements have resulted in some friction within the family, but his primary concern is his sister's health.

&gt; ""I'm also concerned if she heads out, because she is not protected and she can spread it to me. She has other health issues such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol, which she refuses medication for,"" said Mr Lim.

&gt; Booster shots were rolled out for those aged 50 and above a week ago, but some seniors have decided against taking the third dose of the vaccine.

&gt; Retired maintenance officer Jeswant Singh, 68, said he has heard of people getting ""all kinds of problems"" following the booster shot.

&gt; He said: ""A lot of old people come and tell me after their third vaccination they have headaches.

&gt; ""I am comfortable with two (vaccinations). I see no difference. The Government said that the vaccine is just a precaution and so I got the first two.""

&gt; Mr Singh was one of two people The Straits Times spoke to who said they would not take the booster. Sitting outside a coffee shop in Beach Road, he said he was not concerned about getting the virus, adding that he had not heard of cases involving the elderly in the area.

&gt; Mr Lim said some seniors may be reluctant to get the vaccine due to misinformation on social media. He added: ""Some of my friends don't trust the vaccine because they think there hasn't been enough research. They think the whole process has been a bit (rushed) and the manufacturers may be keeping some things to themselves.""

&gt; Mr Singh said he relies on WhatsApp chat groups for news, with friends sending links that have been forwarded multiple times.

&gt; Smoking his pipe as he sat in front of a shophouse near the Sultan Mosque, Mr Nordin, 61, also said he would not get the booster shot.

&gt; ""I don't go to crowded places or mix around with other people. I just need to find a place to sit down, have my coffee, and smoke my pipe. And if God tells me I'm okay, then I'll be okay,"" he added.

110,"&gt; # Indonesia to open Bali, Batam and Bintan to some foreign visitors, but not those from Singapore

&gt; JAKARTA - Indonesia is gearing up to reopen Bali and the Riau Islands to foreign visitors from select countries this week in a bid to revive its tourism industry.

&gt; Senior minister Luhut Pandjaitan told a media briefing on Monday (Oct 11) that visitors from 18 countries would be allowed in, and that Singapore was not among the approved countries on the list.

&gt; Airports in Bali and the Riau Islands - where popular tourist islands Batam and Bintan are located - are slated to reopen on Thursday. Both provinces have among the highest vaccination coverage in Indonesia.

&gt; About 98 per cent of Bali’s 4.4 million population have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, while more than 80 per cent have been fully inoculated. In the Riau Islands, 83 per cent of the population have received their first shot, while 58 per cent are fully inoculated.

&gt; Indonesia, which is the worst hit by the pandemic in South-east Asia with over four million cases and more than 140,000 deaths, has said it would reopen the country cautiously and take precautions to prevent another wave of infections.

&gt; Mr Luhut said that only visitors from countries with lower levels of transmissions and a positivity rate of 5 per cent or below will be allowed into Indonesia. The positivity rate refers to the percentage of people who test positive for the virus from those who have been tested.

&gt; These visitors will still need to serve quarantine on arrival, but for a shortened period of five days, said Coordinating Economic Affairs Minister Airlangga Hartarto at the same media briefing. Previously, foreign arrivals were required to serve an eight-day quarantine.

&gt; They are also required to have valid Covid-19 treatment insurance covering at least US$100,000 (S$135,000) and to pay for their hotel accommodation for the quarantine period in advance.

&gt; “The reopening of these places will act as a trial run that later could be replicated in other places in due course,” Mr Airlangga said.

&gt; Currently, only foreigners with diplomatic or employment visas are allowed to enter Indonesia via international airports serving capital Jakarta and North Sulawesi. Others allowed in include medical workers on humanitarian missions and shipping cargo crew.

&gt; “The reopening is expected to help Bali, whose economy today is far below the pre-pandemic times, to recover,” Mr Luhut said.

&gt; The government has earlier said Bali would be reopened for foreign tourists from South Korea, China, Japan and the United Arab Emirates.

&gt; Mr Luhut did not name the 18 countries on the approved list, but said Domestic Affairs Minister Tito Karnavian would issue a circular on the matter.

&gt; When asked about travellers from Singapore, which was a top source of tourists for Indonesia before the pandemic, Mr Luhut said: “There is a list of 18 countries that would be announced, but Singapore, I think, is not on the list because it may not meet the requirements.”

&gt; He was referring to World Health Organisation guidelines for assessing the overall Covid-19 situation in a country.

&gt; Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country, has managed to bring under control its latest surge of Covid-19 cases triggered after the Hari Raya festivities in May.

&gt; The seven-day average for infections peaked in mid-July, with 50,000 cases daily. That number has plunged to 1,200 now.

&gt; Indonesia’s daily death rate has similarly dropped from the seven-day average peak of 1,700 in early August to around 80 in recent days.

&amp;#x200B;

You can't get into the ministers' minds and know what they are thinking, but the main factors are:

1. Unvaccinated people are more likely to transmit covid-19; limiting their interactions with others likely reduces transmission somewhat. Because vaccines aren't perfect especially for asymptomatic infection this effect isn't going to be that big, but when the healthcare system is strained any bit helps.
2. Unvaccinated people are much more likely to get severely ill. This means that reducing the interactions unvaccinated people have would make them less likely to end up in hospitals and ICUs, helping the healthcare system cope. IIRC \~50% of patients needing ICU or oxygen are unvaccinated, even though only \~10% of adults are unvaccinated. This represents a risk ratio of approximately 9x; ie. the unvaccinated are 9x more likely to need oxygen or ICU.
3. Because of point 2, limiting the interactions unvaccinated people have is also for their own good.
4. Because of points 1 and 2, incentivising vaccination likely will help hospitals cope. As such, there is perhaps some level of the government making things a bit more difficult for the unvaccinated. This is not malicious, however; it is just to nudge those who are unvaccinated so that transmission and healthcare load would be lowered.",10/12/2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/q5wbpt/children_up_to_age_12_to_be_allowed_to_travel/hga2vf3/

They're going to keep our death rates / serious cases high and that's going to scare a few countries into not opening their borders to us.

Anyway, I also see that among covid patients, the variability of the features is an issue. Take a classification model between an orchid vs a Rafflesia   for example, so even if you have an imbalanced set, the two flowers look so different - different color, different shape, different stalk numbers, different looks that the machine can learn the variability much easier. So in our covid cases, if there are hidden features, such as a blood disorder that inhibits the production of antibodies against the spike protein and those who have it will surely die for it, then i see potential in the model. So far, I see even those who are obese, unvaccinated, not young (for example Joe Rogan) surviving (seems like he is gonna survive), I am not sure what features to choose. Maybe we can just pick Delta cases only?

In this case, it will be much harder for your model to work, since your target is 99.5 percent belonging to one class if you add in vaccinated, and still 95 percent if you include only the unvaccinated ones. I am not sure how a model can work when it is too overly imbalanced.

So far, I think there should be some kind of mathematical model used in virology when they could predict the number of active cases in the next 2 weeks based on the current rate and they can predict the numbers based on vaccination numbers and age groups, which is already a pretty good prediction.",9/12/2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/plunpz/rsingapore_random_discussion_and_small_questions/hcgb3nf/

&gt; SINGAPORE - For 16-year-old Sheryse Siah, online tuition saves about three hours of travelling time, which means getting some precious extra sleep.

&gt; As the Covid-19 situation worsened in March 2020, Sheryse's mathematics tuition classes at Mad4Math pivoted from in-person group lessons to virtual classes.

&gt; Now, as Singapore eases restrictions, some classes, including Sheryse's, are moving into a hybrid mode, where some students are present physically, while others attend class through Zoom.

&gt; But for some students like Sheryse, the idea of attending tuition classes in-person seems increasingly unattractive.

&gt; This makes it likely that online or hybrid-style classes will continue after the pandemic ends.

&gt; She said: ""I don't see a reason to go in unless there is a pressing need, like if I wanted help with my graphing calculator. But even then, my tutor can send me videos.""

&gt; To her mother, consultancy co-owner Siah Tsu Lyn, 45, having her daughter attend classes online also means convenience and access to tutors who are farther away. Mad4Math is in Bukit Timah, while they live in Kovan.

&gt; She said: ""It saves a lot of time for me as well, because I am her driver... Online classes also seem to have no detrimental effect on her grades, so I'm happy with this arrangement.""

&gt; Ms Chyroline Tan, who owns and operates Mad4Math, said online or hybrid tuition lessons are here to stay even when the Covid-19 pandemic recedes.

&gt; Embracing technology has made things workable or even easier for her and her students, Ms Tan, 45, told The Straits Times.

&gt; ""Only about a third of my students come in for lessons, the rest dial in on Zoom.""

&gt; She has them send in their homework via messaging app Telegram, marks it on her tablet, then sends it back.

&gt; She teaches mainly secondary school students and pre-university students up to their O-level, A-level or International Baccalaureate examinations in groups of up to 13.

&gt; However, she has found that online classes do not work for every student, especially younger ones.

&gt; Ms Tan said: ""Some kids are difficult to read over Zoom and it's hard to tell if they really understand something.

&gt; ""It's also sometimes difficult to get younger ones to pay attention, particularly those in their early teens, like Secondary 1 or 2.""

&gt; 

&gt; Parents of younger children have also found online tuition tricky at times.

&gt; Mother-of-four Alexia Ho, 44, said that while online tuition has worked well for her eldest son, a Secondary 2 student, it is not easy for her younger children, who are in Primary 6, 4 and 1.

&gt; Ms Ho, a former fashion designer who is now a stay-at-home mum, prefers to help her kids with their work herself.

&gt; However, tuition is a must-have for some subjects like their mother tongue, as ""Chinese has always been a struggle for all my kids"".

&gt; She prefers having her children go for in-person lessons, but would be glad to have the option for online classes in the future.

&gt; ""I think online tuition is less effective when they're young - they have a harder time focusing for long periods of time without intervention.""

&gt; Online teaching also does not suit every tutor's style or class set-up.

&gt; Physics tutor Bai Kelei, 38, told ST that as he teaches small groups of two to three students, he relies a lot on visual cues and conversation to check if his students understand the content.

&gt; ""Online lessons are better than no lessons at all, but, for me, it is more of a stop-gap measure.""

&gt; While online or hybrid classes may become the norm in the future, it appears that students and parents must make a decision based on what works best for them, tutors said.

&gt; Ms Tan, who has been tutoring for 26 years, said: ""In the end, it really depends on what the child is like. Is he able to focus by himself, pay attention and do the work, or does he need more supervision?""

&gt; She added: ""Having classes online or offline doesn't really change what the child is like - my students who used to be late in-person are still late for class, even though they just have to dial in.""

149,"&gt; # Various public places in S'pore still see crowds amid spike in community Covid-19 cases

&gt; Crowds were spotted at various public places in Singapore in the past few days, even as local cases increase.

&gt; On Sep. 11, Singapore reported 555 local cases (community and dormitory), and a new cluster was uncovered at Chinatown Complex.

&gt; Some members of the public raised concerns about huge crowds and difficulties to keep safe distance from strangers in public spaces.

&gt; Here's a scene captured at a bus stop in Admiralty:

&gt; The person who took the photo shared with Shin Min Daily News that during peak hours, there can be as many as over 80 people waiting there.

&gt; They are a mix of commuters waiting for public buses and factory workers waiting for arranged transport.

&gt; It is difficult to keep a safe distance in such situations, she said.

&gt; Another netizen also shared photos of a train filled with commuters on a train along the North-East Line on Sep. 5.

&gt; Mothership understands that staff members have been deployed to both MRT stations and trains to urge commuters to avoid talking on the train to reduce chances of virus transmission.

&gt; Crowded malls

&gt; Long queue was sighted at Harbourfront MRT station as people waited to enter Vivo City which had reached its maximum capacity on Sep. 12 noon.

&gt; A TikToker who posted about the crowd situation said she had waited for an hour to enter Vivo City.

&gt; At around 7:30pm, Space Out indicated that several malls islandwide are either crowded or have hit their maximum capacity.

&gt; Malls indicated as having maximum crowd levels (in dark red) include Clementi Mall, NEX, JEM, 313 @ Somerset, Paya Lebar Quarter.

&gt; Having said that, a survey done by Chinese media Zaobao.sg shows close to 90 per cent of respondents planning to reduce going out and will only make essential trips.

&gt; Zaobao also reported that retailers shared a drop in patrons over the weekend after Friday's Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) announcement.

&gt; If you wish to head out, don't forget to use nifty websites like Space Out and Safe Distance @ Parks to avoid crowded areas.

150,"First of all, the current protocols for hospitalisation is ridiculous. As long as you test positive for Covid and show ANY symptom, you’re hospitalised. 

The vast majority of people only display mild symptoms, especially now that most people have been vaccinated. Even before vaccinations, during the peak of the dorm outbreaks, virtually all of the foreign workers were asymptomatic but they were hospitalised too, which put a great load on our healthcare system. 

This is precisely the reason why from tomorrow onwards, our protocol for quarantine is changing. It is illogical to hospitalise people with mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. We don’t do that for any other illness. 

Now, dealing with your 100% vaccination criteria before we open up. What should we do about people who are ineligible to get the jab then? Wait it out until there’s a viable vaccine for them?

153,"&gt; You are assuming that the results of the 2 tests are independent, but why would they be?

One possible reason could be that there is some variability during the course of manufacturing, since the quality control tolerance for a cheap $10 test are unlikely to be super tight.

&gt; The false positive is likely to be because there's something in the person's mucus that triggers the positive result, either acidic pH (https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210705-how-children-are-spoofing-covid-19-tests-with-soft-drinks) or maybe some common cold coronavirus or unknown bacteria that cross-reacts with the antibody.

Acidic pH is unlikely to be the reason for false positives, because each kit contains a buffer that will neutralise any excess acidity. This is explicitly stated in the link you provided: *Maintaining an ideal pH for the antibodies is key to the correct function of the test, and that’s the job of the liquid buffer solution that you mix your sample with, provided with the test. The critical role of the buffer is highlighted by the fact that if you mix cola with the buffer – as shown in this debunking of an Austrian politician’s claim that mass testing is worthless – then the LFTs behave exactly as you’d expect: negative for Covid-19.*",9/12/2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/pms2nn/primary_school_children_to_be_given_3_covid19/hckcbp7/

&gt; SINGAPORE: Singapore reported 550 new locally transmitted COVID-19 infections as of noon on Saturday (Sep 11), comprising 486 community cases and 64 dormitory residents.

&gt; Among the local cases, 145 are seniors above 60 years old, said the Ministry of Health (MOH).

&gt; Two more large clusters were identified, including Chinatown Complex with 44 new cases.

&gt; This brings the total number of infections linked to the cluster to 66 - comprising 58 stallholders and assistants, four cleaners, one safe distancing ambassador and three household contacts of workers.

&gt; The other large cluster is PCF Sparkletots Braddell Heights, located at 335 Serangoon Avenue 3. There are three new cases and a total of 22 infections linked to the cluster.

&gt; Transmission at the pre-school took place among students in the same class, with further spread to household contacts of cases, said MOH.

&gt; Saturday's number of local infections is a slight dip from the 568 cases reported the day before, breaking a chain of five consecutive days of increases.

164,"&gt; # Top Japanese egg producer to set up S$100m farm in Singapore, boosting local production to meet half of domestic demand

&gt; ""Having these capabilities will allow us to better secure the upstream input needed for egg production, which we currently import, and hold a significant segment of the egg production cycle within Singapore,"" SFA chief executive officer (CEO) Lim Kok Thai said at the MOU signing ceremony on Friday.

&gt; This also strengthens production resilience during a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has put pressure on supply chains, and comes as Singapore pushes ahead with its target of producing 30 per cent of its nutritional needs locally by 2030, known as the ""30 by 30"" vision.

&gt; Singapore’s current egg farms only import the day-old chicks that lay eggs for consumption.

&gt; SFA will award four farm plots of about 13 ha in total on 30-year leases to IFH at market value. The farms will be in Tuas, Sungei Tengah and Lim Chu Kang.

&gt; Construction on the facilities is expected to start from 2022, and the farms will begin operating in phases from 2024 to 2026.

&gt; Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said in a statement that IFH’s operations in Singapore will create good jobs for Singaporeans in the agri-food and sustainability sectors, and raise the capability and resilience of Singapore’s local egg industry.

&gt; “This will support us in our push towards strengthening Singapore’s overall food security in a productive, climate-resilient and sustainable manner,” she added.

&gt; HOW THE PROJECT CAME TO BE

&gt; In 2019, IFH reached out to SFA regarding the project, which is said will use an integrated system to ensure a stable supply of eggs.

&gt; IFH CEO Tsukino Yoshikawa said on Friday that the company is looking at producing grains that are healthy for both humans and animals.

&gt; ""In terms of new technology such as artificial intelligence and Internet of things, we plan on working with various research institutes both in Singapore and Japan to help us improve the working environment, strengthen measures against infectious diseases, while also protecting animals,"" she said.

&gt; IFH did not have to go through a tender process before being awarded the plots of land as its multi-faceted project, coupled with significant investment, is expected to benefit not just Singapore's food resilience, but the country's agricultural ecosystem as a whole.

&gt; For instance, IFH's need for a strong local core of agri-food workers will mean ""exciting science and technology jobs"" in the agri-food space in the near future, Mr Lim said.

&gt; ""This project will also enable ISE to build up exportable capabilities to develop 'farms-of-the-future' which would strengthen food resilience in the region,"" he added.

165,"&gt; # Woman pulls off SDA’s mask in face-off at Marina Bay Sands

&gt; A man and a woman were seen in a dispute with the Safe Distancing Ambassadors at Marina Bay Sands on the evening of Sep. 11.

&gt; In a series of videos recorded by one Mothership reader, the clips showed the duo in a heated conversation with three Safe Distancing Ambassadors (SDAs).

&gt; It was unclear why the SDAs approached them or why the duo was agitated.

&gt; The video showed the duo being approached by two women and a male SDA.

&gt; In the first video seen by Mothership, the woman, who was dressed in a white blouse with her mask on her chin, approached a woman ambassador who was recording the whole incident on her phone.

&gt; The woman in a white blouse, with one arm on her waist, then caught one of the female SDAs off guard by pulling down her mask for reasons unknown during the confrontation.

&gt; In another clip, the man, who was wearing a white t-shirt and light blue pair of shorts, was sighted scolding the SDAs while the woman attempted to pull him away.

&gt; During the confrontation, the man pulled down his mask halfway through talking at one point.

&gt; In another clip, the woman in a white blouse was seen to be ""pushing"" the male SDA by walking closely towards him, forcing the SDA to take a step back every time.

&gt; The duo was then separated, the woman was escorted by the two female SDAs while the man was with the male ambassador.

&gt; The woman again was sighted with arms on her waist and walking closely towards one of the SDAs near the fountain.

&gt; Mothership has reached out to the relevant authorities for their statement.

&gt; Critical period

&gt; The incident sighted at MBS the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) provided an update on the Covid-19 situation in Singapore.

&gt; While the spike in community cases is not entirely unexpected, the MTF co-chairs said that the increase in local cases was quicker than expected and urged members of the public to avoid heading out and keep to the Covid-19 rules.

&gt; Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong said at the press conference that the next two to four weeks will be a critical period to observe if the current patients will become severely ill or develop complications.

178,"&gt; # Commentary: Maybe there is no such thing as too many BTO flats?

&gt; SINGAPORE: When the Housing Development Board (HBD) launched a batch of Build-To-Order (BTO) flats in Hougang in August, 11,420 applicants competed for 460 4-room units.

&gt; The over-subscription rate was 25 times for 4-room flats – one of the largest for a non-mature estate in recent years. In particular, Kovan Wellspring, next to Kovan MRT station, attracted strong interest.

&gt; Earlier in May, 3,474 applicants vied for 70 Telok Blangah Beacon 4-room flats near the future Greater Southern Waterfront – an oversubscription rate of almost 50 times.

&gt; Both speak to the strong demand for BTO flats, more largely reflected in the average over-subscription rate by first-timers for 3-room and bigger units of 4.1 and 4.7 times in 2020 and 2021 respectively.

&gt; Perhaps foreseeing that the pandemic is unlikely to temper continued interest in housing, Minister for National Development Desmond Lee announced in July that HDB will launch more than 17,000 BTO units in 2022.

&gt; This is higher than the 14,600 units in pre-COVID 2019 and the 16,800 in 2020.

&gt; Highlighting that HDB has added BTO flats to the housing stock over the years to meet the needs of young families including echo boomers and millennials, Mr Lee’s announcement, however, begs the question of whether this boost in supply might result in a glut if demand for BTO flats cools.

&gt; Wouldn’t most prospective home buyers simply turn to the resale market if delays in housing construction continue?

198,"&gt; # S'pore should make Covid-19 vaccination mandatory, so measures can ease for everyone

&gt; SINGAPORE - There is no way to stop Covid-19 infections from spreading. The only thing that prolonging, or even enhancing, safety measures can do is to slow that spread - which is Singapore's current game plan.

&gt; But eventually, large swathes of the population, whether vaccinated or not, will likely encounter the coronavirus.

&gt; Last Monday (Sept 6), the Government said quick action was needed to dampen the increasing likelihood of an ""exponential rise"" in cases, even as Singapore hits 81 per cent in its full vaccination rate.

&gt; Finance Minister Lawrence Wong announced more frequent rostered routine testing for people in higher-risk settings and mandatory testing and self-isolation for those who get health risk warnings. He also urged Singaporeans to limit non-essential social interactions.

&gt; Some quarters expressed disappointment, pointing out how the Government had earlier said measures would be eased once 80 per cent of the population had been fully vaccinated.

&gt; But dining in at restaurants remains capped at five people if all are vaccinated, and two at hawker centres regardless of vaccination status. Working from home is still the default with only half the employees allowed back at the office, and workplace socialising in the office is prohibited.

&gt; Explaining the decision further last Friday, Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong, a co-chair of the multi-ministry task force on Covid-19, said: ""We want to be cautious and give ourselves more time to be certain that the high number of daily cases will not result in a high number of serious cases or deaths.""

&gt; Further relaxation of measures would be postponed for two to three more weeks, the task force said.

&gt; Its main fear is hospital services being overwhelmed with the rise in infections.

&gt; As a precaution, the Ministry of Health has told public hospitals to postpone non-urgent cases to free up room for the surge in Covid-19 patients. Non-urgent or elective cases include treatment of serious ailments, such as surgery for cancer.

&gt; Looking at the current Covid-19 numbers, the Government's recent moves seem, to me, way too precautionary.

&gt; There are now more than 700 Covid-19 patients in hospital but many of them could actually be recovering at home.

&gt; Health Minister Ong Ye Kung pointed out that ""the large majority of infected patients are in hospital more for observation, and most are discharged uneventfully"".

&gt; Hence the decision, announced last Friday, to allow more Covid-19 patients to recover at home, instead of occupying a hospital bed.

&gt; A further 2,000 infected adults below the age of 60 who are well or only mildly ill, are housed at community care facilities.

&gt; Of the current hospitalised patients, 35 need oxygen and seven are in intensive care.

&gt; These might seem like small numbers, but Director of Medical Services Kenneth Mak noted that the Delta variant spreading here now doubles the risk of serious illness compared to earlier variants.

&gt; The task force ministers also stressed that it is not the current numbers, but those that may be coming, that are worrying.

&gt; There is a roughly two-week time lag between infection and serious illness where a patient needs oxygen or intensive care. So a rule of thumb tells us that the 42 seriously ill people on Sunday are based on the 120 newly infected people identified a fortnight ago.

&gt; Last Friday, there were 568 new locally transmitted Covid-19 cases. On Saturday, there were 550 such cases.

&gt; In a fortnight's time, how many will be seriously ill? Meanwhile, the number of new infections continues to rise.

&gt; Said Mr Wong: ""Very soon, we will reach 1,000 new cases a day, and in a few weeks' time, we will probably get to 2,000 new cases a day.""

&gt; Whether the number of seriously ill people will increase in tandem is the biggest question, but this will hopefully not materialise as more people get vaccinated.

&gt; Vaccination has a huge impact on how many people get seriously ill or die as a result of infection. So far, the rates of increase in infections and serious illness differ, with the rate of infections rising faster.

&gt; If this disconnect continues, then Singapore can safely ease measures as it shows that vaccines are doing a good job.

&gt; But if the rise in infection sees a tandem rise in serious illness, then even stricter measures might have to be imposed. This is to give seriously ill patients the best possible care and stop the healthcare system from being overwhelmed.

&gt; 

&gt; So far, the rates of increase in infections and serious illness differ, with the rate of infections rising faster. ST PHOTO: GIN TAY

&gt; 

&gt; Reflecting its concern, the task force mentioned the term intensive care unit, or ICU, 49 times during Friday's 90-minute press conference.

&gt; Similarly, there were several references to what is happening in Israel, which has a population 50 per cent larger than Singapore's.

&gt; Israel eased measures when more than 60 per cent of the population was fully vaccinated. There was a surge in cases as thousands were infected, and it is now seeing about 25 deaths a day.

&gt; While the vaccination rate here is higher, the worry remains that Singapore's trajectory might follow Israel's.

&gt; But the latest Morbidity and Mortality Weekly report by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States issued last Friday said that in spite of Delta being more infectious and causing more illness, the risk of infection for vaccinated people there is only around a fifth than for those not vaccinated.

&gt; Vaccines offer 10 times more protection against the need for hospital care or death, the report said.

&gt; In Singapore, 99.3 per cent of fully vaccinated people who get infected have been mildly sick or asymptomatic. In other words, only seven out of 1,000 people infected risk severe illness or death. In contrast, among the unvaccinated, 45 out of 1,000 people infected became seriously ill.

&gt; Over the past four weeks, 3,516 vaccinated people were infected, with 246 getting seriously ill. While only 616 who were not vaccinated were infected, they accounted for 277 seriously ill patients.

&gt; Of the 58 people who have died as a result of Covid-19 here, only one was fully vaccinated.

&gt; The problem clearly lies with people who have not been vaccinated.

&gt; To date, 84 per cent of the population have received at least one jab of a vaccine. About half of those not vaccinated are children under the age of 12, for whom there is currently no approved vaccine. There are also some people for whom vaccines are not a medically viable option.

&gt; It is the estimated 500,000 people who are eligible but have chosen not to get vaccinated who are threatening the healthcare system.

&gt; They are more likely to need hospital care, if infected. If this leads to more postponement of treatment for people with other health problems, then their choice also impacts the health of others.

&gt; Associate Professor Mak also pointed out that among symptomatic patients, those who have been vaccinated are no longer infectious after nine days, while those who have not been vaccinated could take up to 16 days to clear the viral load to the point of not being infectious.

&gt; So it is the unvaccinated people who hold the key to how fast Singapore can open up.

&gt; As Mr Ong said: ""To go through this experience differently from other countries, (with) as few deaths as possible without a prolonged hard lockdown, the key is vaccination.""

&gt; Perhaps it is time the Government mandates vaccination for all who are medically eligible for it.

&gt; The argument against doing so is that none of the vaccines have received normal approval. They have been approved only under pandemic conditions.

&gt; However, millions of people here, and hundreds of millions globally, have been vaccinated, with very low rates of adverse reactions.

&gt; Previously, there were people who feared the novel messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) Covid-19 vaccines used in the national programme. But there are now other options, such as Sinovac which uses more traditional vaccine methods. It is timely to re-think this issue.

&gt; Mandatory vaccination is not a new concept. That was largely how the world eradicated smallpox.

&gt; In Singapore, it is legally required for children to be vaccinated against diphtheria and measles.

&gt; If the Government takes over control of this key that Mr Ong mentioned, then the lock on the economy and people's lives can be opened sooner.

199,"It’s in the original post 


Copy-and-pasted from the original source, for those of you who don't want to puzzle out images of a phone reading Tumblr, or whatever.  Not my words, so please don't yell at me.

Why are vaccinated people still testing positive for Covid but not getting as sick?

It’s All about the type of immunoglobulins produced from vaccination. For those of you who are hardcore scientists, ignore this post- it’s geared toward lay people and meant to be easy to understand. I’m going to do an epic under-simplification of a very complicated subject. Look away!

IgG is a type of immunoglobulin (antibody) that is plentiful in our blood serum. These are the immune proteins that our Covid vaccine is really good at producing.

IgA is a type of immunoglobulin that is plentiful in our mucous membranes, like the respiratory tract (nose and throat). Unfortunately, our injected vaccines are NOT very good at creating a lasting army of this type of antibody.

SARS-Cov-2 (virus) that causes the disease Covid-19 is a respiratory virus- meaning, that it enters the body through the respiratory mucosa. It sets up shop in the area of the back of the throat where the nasal passage meets, called the nasopharynx. While it’s there, it enters those cells and reproduces. Once it reproduces in high enough numbers, it moves it’s way down the respiratory tract and attacks lung cells. From there, it enters the whole body and attacks almost every organ system.

When you are vaccinated, your mucous membranes in the back of your throat are still relatively unprotected, because they lack the IgA antibody response at the mucous membrane level.  This is why a vaccinated person is still showing high viral loads in their nasopharynx area when swabbed. However, once the virus tries to move down into the lungs, the very good vaccine induced IgGs that are circulating in a vaccinated person’s blood serum, quickly identify the virus and begin destroying it. The body then says, hold on…where’d these guys come from? The antibodies see the open door at the nasopharynx and then move the troops to destroy. This is the reason that vaccinated people are not getting as sick, even though they are getting technically infected and why vaccinated people are contagious for less time than unvaccinated people are. Our defense is delayed, at the upper respiratory tract, but  we eventually have a neutralizing response.

This is why it became important for even vaccinated people to begin wearing masks. We still have several days of the virus successfully replicating in the backs of our throats, which means that when we cough, sing, laugh, talk loudly….we can pass those viruses to other people.  This is new with the delta variant because it is better at unlocking those respiratory cells than other variants were. This is what changed. The previous variants were not as good, and it took them longer to unlock cells and replicate so our vaccine induced serum antibodies used to have more time to recognize and respond than they do now.

So what you’re seeing with vaccinated infected people is: sudden onset sore throat, dry cough from nasopharynx irritation, eventually a fever as the virus tries to make it down the respiratory pathway and your immune system activates, but then a marked reduction in symptoms that suggest that the virus has been unsuccessful at invading any other organ systems. This is your reduction in hospitalizations and deaths. The lungs never get so sick that the person requires oxygen. Vaccine IgGs are very effective at staving off a massive infection, but not great at stopping the virus from initially replicating in the throat.

This might suggest that we should focus efforts/funding into more research and development for nasal spray type vaccines (several are in trials) that produce better IgA response for virus neutralization at the mucous membranes which would be better at halting transmissions of the virus between people.

The data must be viewed as a whole, overall demand on the healthcare system is more important than the demand from the vaccinated subgroup. As much as some radical people might want, it is unethical to reject patients and leave them to die simply because they are unvaccinated. Usage from unvaccinated people counts too.

To loosen restrictions, the demand on the healthcare system must be within acceptable limits. If not, hospitals will be full and everyone, vaccinated or not, could be fucked (hospital serves more than just covid patients, they can’t tell everyone else to fuck off). This means, we cannot look only at present data. We must also react based on projections (eg: if your projections says hospital will be full in 3 months, you can’t just sit back and do nothing just because it’s not full yet, because that would be too late).

Some people might not get it that we need to also look beyond the present and also think a few steps in advance.

To consider loosening restrictions, the key data is the rate of case increase and overall percentage/proportion that ends up in hospital or worse. Basically, these tells us how things are expected to unfold. Usage data like hospitalisation count and oxygen users are data that hints at how the proportion of cases with hospital usage is like.

&gt; SINGAPORE: All in-person visits to residential care homes will be suspended from Monday (Sep 13) after an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases among staff, clients and residents.

&gt; Forty-two cases across 18 aged care facilities have been detected in the past two weeks, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Sunday. “With the number of cases expected to continue to rise in the coming weeks, we need to take further action to protect the vulnerable seniors in these settings,” the ministry added.

&gt; Visits will be suspended for four weeks, until Oct 11. “This temporary suspension of visitation will give us time to encourage more unvaccinated seniors to get vaccinated, and roll out the vaccine booster programme for residents of aged care facilities,” said the Health Ministry.

&gt; STAFF, RESIDENTS TO BE TESTED MORE FREQUENTLY

&gt; Employees, residents and clients of aged care facilities will be tested more frequently with Antigen Rapid Tests (ART) as part of efforts to “strengthen” the testing regime, MOH said.

&gt; The ministry also encouraged the next-of-kin of unvaccinated seniors in aged care facilities “to support and encourage their loved ones to be vaccinated”.

&gt; “Unvaccinated seniors may suffer severe illness if infected. It is also important for vaccinated seniors to receive the booster vaccination when it is made available, to ensure a continued high level of immunity and protection from severe disease,” the Health Ministry said.

Say could we use ML to train models - cases everyday can be analysed based on composition and risk factors (age profile, co-morbidities which lead to severe cases and vaccination/not completely vaccinated) and project the rate of severe cases within the immediate days to help facilitate policy making?

227,"&gt; # More people killed or injured in S'pore road accidents in first half of this year

&gt; SINGAPORE - More people were killed or injured in traffic accidents in the first half of this year.

&gt; This is likely due to the rise in the number of vehicles on the road as Covid-19 restrictions were relaxed, compared with the first half of last year when there was a circuit breaker, the police said on Wednesday (Sept 8).

&gt; There were 3,635 fatalities and injuries reported from January to June, up 17 per cent from 3,108 in the same period last year, the latest figures released by the police show.

&gt; The number of accidents resulting in injuries or death rose by 16.2 per cent to 2,998, from 2,579 in the same period last year.

&gt; A total of 58 people died in 52 accidents in the first half of this year, seven more than the 51 fatalities in 49 accidents in the first half of 2020.

&gt; The police said fatal accidents involving elderly pedestrians and motorcyclists remain a key concern. ""While the number of fatal accidents involving elderly pedestrians and motorcyclists has decreased... they continue to account for a disproportionate number of traffic accidents resulting in injuries or death,"" they added.

&gt; Elderly pedestrian deaths fell from eight to five, while that of motorcyclists and pillion riders dipped from 31 to 26 in the first half of this year.

&gt; Collectively, they make up 53.4 per cent of traffic fatalities in the first half of 2021.

&gt; The police added that 47.1 per cent of accidents involving elderly pedestrians were due to jaywalking.

&gt; ""For their safety, elderly pedestrians are advised to use pedestrian crossings or overhead bridges to cross the roads,"" they said.

&gt; Also on the rise is the number of drink-driving accidents. The police said there were 77 such cases in the first half of this year, a 20.3 per cent increase from 64 cases in the same period last year.

&gt; The number of those nabbed for drink driving rose by 7.7 per cent to 724 from 672.

&gt; While there were fewer speeding violations - 66,270 compared with 94,348 in the first half of last year - the number of speeding-related accidents rose by 25.3 per cent to 426, from 340 in the first half of last year.

&gt; Motorists ran fewer red lights on the roads in the first half of this year - violations fell by 0.8 per cent to 23,952, from last year’s 24,147. Accidents caused by running of red lights also dipped from 51 to 47.

&gt; In general, the police said the number of traffic accidents and violations were lower than in the pre-Covid-19 period, due to lighter traffic on the roads as more people stayed home.

&gt; Compared with the first half of 2019, for example, the number of traffic accidents resulting in fatalities or injuries fell by 21.8 per cent.

&gt; “Going forward, as traffic volume increases with the resumption of more activities, we can expect traffic accidents and violation figures to increase,” they added.

&gt; SINGAPORE - Chinatown Complex will be closed to all members of the public from 3pm on Sept 12 to 11.59pm on Sept 15, as the Ministry of Health reported a total of 66 cases linked to the cluster there.

&gt; All staff working at Chinatown Complex are being tested for Covid-19, it added.

&gt; To contain the cluster quickly, people who have logged in with SafeEntry to Chinatown Complex from Sept 8 to Sept 11 will be issued Health Risk Alerts.

&gt; MOH said: ""They are strongly encouraged to go for a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test as soon as possible and to reduce their social interactions for 14 days.""

&gt; MOH is also extending free Covid-19 testing to members of the public who had visited Chinatown Complex between Sept 8 and Sept 11, but who do not receive the alerts.

&gt; They can refer to https://go.gov.sg/chinatown-complex-testing for details on the testing operations.

&gt; Of the 66 cases linked to the cluster, 63 work at Chinatown Complex.

&gt; They include 58 stallholders and stall assistants, four cleaners and one Safe Distancing Ambassador working at the complex.

&gt; The remaining three are household contacts of infected cases.

&gt; MOH also reported a total of 555 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday (Sept 11), with 486 community and 64 dormitory resident cases.

&gt; Five cases were imported.

&gt; Three new cases were added to the PCF Sparkletots Braddell Heights cluster, taking the total to 22.

&gt; MOH reported transmission among students in the same class, with further spread to household contact of cases.

&gt; There were also 31 new cases added to the clusters linked to staff at six bus interchanges at Punggol, Toa Payoh, Tampines, Boon Lay, Clementi and Jurong East.

&gt; The total number of cases at these interchanges is 606.

249,"&gt; # Primary school children to be given 3 Covid-19 self-test kits after September holidays

&gt; SINGAPORE - All primary school pupils will be given three antigen rapid test (ART) kits from Monday (Sept 13), as they return from their September holiday break.

&gt; This is part of a four-pronged approach set out by Education Minister Chan Chun Sing in a Facebook post on Sunday to keep schools safe. It also includes keeping children at home if they are unwell, safe management measures (SMMs) in schools, and ring-fencing known Covid-19 cases and contacts.

&gt; Mr Chan encouraged all families to help students do a self-test at home this week, and familiarise themselves with the procedure.

&gt; He said: ""This will also serve as a one-time sweep to assure one another that our children are safe. In time to come, we may also request for additional self-tests to be done.""

&gt; The remaining two test kits are for ""future contingencies, which we will replenish as necessary"", he added.

&gt; Last month, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said the authorities would also distribute ART kits to all pupils and staff in Early Childhood Development Agency-licensed pre-schools, Ministry of Education kindergartens, early intervention centres, and the primary or junior sections of special education schools.

&gt; Mr Chan also urged parents not to send their children to school if the child is unwell, or if a family member is undergoing quarantine or required to be in isolation.

&gt; Co-curricular activities (CCAs) will remain suspended, and SMMs such as mask wearing and good personal hygiene practices will continue as they have ""thus far helped us to minimise the risks of transmission within schools"", he said.

&gt; Lastly, the minister said the rapid isolation and ring-fencing of known cases and their close contacts will continue, in order to ""minimise transmission risks and disruption to the rest of the students, staff and families"".

&gt; ""This sustainable approach will allow our children to continue learning safely,"" he said.

&gt; ""While the children who have contracted Covid-19 thus far have relatively mild symptoms, we must remain vigilant.""

&gt; There were 22 Covid-19 cases aged between zero and 11 years old on Saturday.

&gt; Mr Chan also urged everyone to ""encourage family and friends to be vaccinated to minimise the risks to our children who cannot be vaccinated yet"".

&gt; ""It will take the collective efforts of our community to keep our children safe,"" he added.

Specific to Schooling, I don't think that it was wrong to criticise his performance, especially since he was expected to do a lot better. Of course some did take the criticism too far and turned it into an ad hominem attack.   
The reaction towards criticism of him also I feel some were an overreaction to some legitimate criticism of his performance. So many have been shitting on the national football team for time immemorial but I don't see a collective national effort to defend the footballers like we saw for Schooling. But everytime we criticise the national team for their performance, it does not mean that everyone who criticised are fair-weather supporters.   
I was actually quite critical of the Lions last international outing. I mean, in no way was a 12 goal deficit over 3 games defensible. But while the Lions had not been really performing up to par, when I could, I still turn up to support, even in games they are likely to lose. I wear my Singapore jersey proudly, and I believe that it's just excuses for those who wear Man Utd, Liverpool, Arsenal jerseys to national games and say that they want to save money on a Singapore kit. In essence, this is what I believe 'not being a fair weather supporter' should be: not just about always refraining from criticising poor results, especially when justifiably so, but actually do more to show our support. Turn up to support them in person (post-covid of course), whether it's football, netball, rugby, etc. Encourage our kids in their sports pursuit. Wear the national kits proudly.

273,"&gt;So because the long term risk are not known as you agree to, I feel that those who don't want to vaccinate for those reasons are justified no?

Though I don't agree with their judgement, I agree that their decision is justifiable. Having said that, my agreement is conditioned on they being properly informed based of the real science.

My point about other countries is that I agree that we are in a better shape now. But I don't share your optimism (yet). The delta variant trajectory is still far from certain. For one, there is not much consensus of the vaccine efficacy for this variant. We certainly know that vaccinated people are less likely to be infected and if infected will be less sick. But nobody can be sure if the lessen degree is sufficiently low that our unvaccinated won't be hospitalised or die in droves like what's happening in those countries. It is very important to remember that children under 12 are still unvaccinated.

274,"&gt; # Number of contact tracers up by nearly 50% since mid-July, with sharp rise in Covid-19 cases

&gt; SINGAPORE - The number of people working as contact tracers, to find those with possible exposure to Covid-19, has been increased by nearly half since mid-July, the Ministry of Health (MOH) told The Straits Times on Thursday (Aug 12).

&gt; The number of contact tracers has gone up from about 330 to about 480 now, along with the recent increase in cases.

&gt; Singapore saw a sudden surge of coronavirus infections after a cluster surrounding KTV lounges was announced on July 12, with the daily number of community cases, zero just two days earlier, soon hitting double, and then triple, digits.

&gt; Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said on Aug 2 that for a ""small number"" of cases, it had taken 14 days, from the point of notification of a confirmed case, to issue a quarantine order to close contacts.

&gt; This was due to the difficulty in tracing the contacts of the infected people in these cases, he said.

&gt; The number of cases remained high throughout late July and early August, with another major cluster linked to the Jurong Fishery Port emerging.

&gt; On Thursday, MOH said the number of contact tracers had been ramped up over the past month, given the increased need for their work, to enable potential cases to be detected and ring-fenced rapidly.

&gt; The contact tracing team consists of officers from various ministries and volunteers from MOH statutory boards and the public service, and is further supplemented with manpower from external service providers.

&gt; ST reported in June that the Singapore Armed Forces and police were helping to boost the supply of contact tracers.

&gt; MOH also said on Thursday that about 100 beds in intensive care units (ICU) across Singapore have been set aside for Covid-19 patients.

&gt; ""We are able to expand our ICU capacity if needed to cater for any increase in Covid-19 cases who require critical care,"" said the ministry.

&gt; It added that it has been working with public hospitals to progressively expand their capacity to care for Covid-19 patients.

&gt; Measures taken include retrofitting general wards for easier conversion into isolation and intensive care rooms if needed.

&gt; The ministry said it has also ensured sufficient supply of medical equipment such as ventilators and medication.

&gt; Neither MOH nor any of the three public healthcare clusters gave details on how many general wards have been converted into wards for Covid-19 patients.

&gt; However, Professor Leo Yee Sin, executive director of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), said it and Tan Tock Seng Hospital - both of which have been at the centre of the pandemic - now have thrice the number of isolation beds they had before Covid-19 broke out here early last year.

&gt; NCID and other public healthcare institutions here are also rescheduling some non-urgent consultations or reducing non-urgent surgical work to dedicate more resources to fighting the pandemic.

&gt; Prof Leo added that NCID is caring for about one-third of all hospitalised Covid-19 patients here, with patients in recovery and those with milder conditions being admitted to community care facilities (CCFs).

&gt; These CCFs currently have the capacity to accommodate more than 5,000 people, and more capacity can be added if needed, said MOH.

&gt; The CCFs are mainly run by private managing agents and healthcare providers, and supported by public healthcare manpower.

&gt; MOH added that the SG Healthcare Corps has also been deployed to support CCFs and other operations.

&gt; The corps is a medical reserve force set up in April last year to marshal volunteers in the fight against Covid-19. It consists mainly of medical staff from the private sector, retired medical professionals, and those who are medically trained but no longer practising.

&gt; Asked what could be done to ensure Covid-19 cases do not overwhelm the healthcare sector, Prof Leo said: ""Response to the outbreak does not rest with NCID or the healthcare sector alone. The community plays a big part in preventing the spread of the disease, such as keeping to safe management measures, taking up Covid-19 vaccination, and supporting one another to strengthen mental resilience and social stability.""

&gt; SINGAPORE - The authorities are taking to court a food and beverage establishment which they allegedly shuttered its main entrance to conceal the consumption of liquor in the premises after 10.30pm.

&gt; In a statement on Thursday (Aug 12), the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) said Darts Buddy did so avoid to detection by law enforcement officers.

&gt; But safe-distancing enforcement officers noticed patrons entering and exiting the premises at 28 Beatty Road through a rear door just before an inspection at 10.40pm.

&gt; The incident happened on Jan 29 this year.

&gt; Darts Buddy, known for its pizza, bistro and sports bars, will face charges on Friday under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act and may face a fine of up to $10,000 and imprisonment of up to six months.

This basically sums up everything. 

The post implied that vaccines are useless because a small proportion of vaccinated people can still get infected. This misleading argument is also known as the nirvana fallacy. Lahren dismissed a solution because it is imperfect, even though a perfect solution is impossible.

No vaccine is 100% effective, and COVID-19 vaccines aren’t an exception. However, this doesn’t mean we should reject them, just as we wouldn’t reject a parachute before jumping from an airplane just because they don’t open in 100% of the cases.

The problem is, the idea of a mRNA (?) vaccine is a novel idea. I wouldn’t be surprised if there is insufficient research to explain its effects 20 years later. For all we know, there may be devastating health effects that are not immediately obvious. That’s one of the reasons why vaccination trials often take decades before approval. 

For all we know, we could all drop dead, or be exposed to some life threatening illness in another 20-30 years.

302,"&gt; # Israeli embassy decries ex-PSP member's post comparing vaccine measures to Holocaust

&gt; SINGAPORE - The Embassy of Israel in Singapore on Thursday (Aug 12) said it strongly condemns a social media post by opposition politician Brad Bowyer likening Singapore's differentiated vaccination regulations to the Holocaust.

&gt; ""The Holocaust was a genocide perpetrated by the Nazi regime to slaughter six million innocent Jews and comparing the obvious health benefits of vaccinations that have benefited billions around the world is not only in bad taste, but is also Holocaust distortion by downplaying the horrors of the Holocaust,"" the embassy wrote in a Facebook post.

&gt; This comes a day after Mr Bowyer quit the Progress Singapore Party following widespread uproar over successive contentious posts calling into question Covid-19 pandemic measures.

&gt; He had confirmed to The Straits Times that his resignation was of his own accord, adding: ""Being so vocal on this takes me out of full alignment with the party, and I am not going to let anyone derail PSP while I fight my own battles.""

&gt; Early on Tuesday morning he had uploaded to Facebook an image of the Auschwitz concentration camp, operated by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland, where over one million were murdered during World War II, with superimposed text that read: ""It didn't start with gas chambers. It started with one party controlling the media.... One party dividing citizens into 'us' and 'them' and calling on their supporters to harass 'them'...""

&gt; Mr Bowyer captioned the post, which remains up on the social media platform, to say: ""Singapore is now us and them... God help our nation!""

&gt; The losing candidate for Nee Soon GRC at last year's polls has continued to defend his actions, telling ST that ""sometimes a shocking image is needed to wake people up"".

&gt; On Thursday, the Israeli embassy wrote: ""We urge others to think twice before re-sharing such content - there is no equal for the tragedies that occurred during the Holocaust.""

&gt; The embassy also left a comment on the post, urging others to refrain from spreading vaccine misinformation and from continuing to draw comparisons between the Holocaust and vaccination campaigns.

306,"It's not logical to be swayed by the potential long term effects of vaccine. The dichotomy between private detriment and public good is a false one. 

We know for a fact that COVID-19, especially in its most serious forms will leave long term effects, with some rendering victims invalids. We know that vaccinations could possibly, maybe, in the worst case, leave long term effects, though we have thus far not seen systemic trends, unlike COVID-19, despite having administered hundreds of millions of doses thus far. This shows that the chance of long term effects from vaccines is exceedingly rare, if any. In fact, vaccines have been known to reverse and minimise the effects of long Covid. Therefore, it is highly unlikely to be the cause of it. While there is no guarantee that vaccines will have no long term effects, the probabilities seem to be exceedingly low.

Given the option of a 5% chance of catching long term effects from the virus and a non-zero, but functionally negligible chance of catching long term effects from the vaccine, the choice is clear. Public good is private good. 

It's thus inadmissable to justify a willful choice not to get vaccinated, despite eligibility on grounds of self preservation. The premise of such a claim is just false.",8/12/2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/p25own/you_cant_have_your_cake_and_eat_it_too_post_by/h8mx4h4/

308,"&gt; # Not just coughing and sneezing - talking and singing can also spread Covid-19: NUS study

&gt; SINGAPORE - A new study by a National University of Singapore (NUS) team has found that an infected person can spread Covid-19 by exhaling fine aerosol particles when breathing, talking and singing, not just though droplets when coughing or sneezing.

&gt; The authors of the study on Wednesday (Aug 11) said the research findings reinforce the need for infection control measures - such as social distancing, mask-wearing and increased room ventilation - especially in an indoor environment, where airborne transmission of the virus is most likely to occur.

&gt; The study, led by researchers from NUS and conducted at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), showed that talking and singing can produce two types of viral particles - fine aerosols (less than 5 micrometres in size), and coarse aerosols (larger than 5 micrometres).

&gt; The fine aerosols generated from both types of activities contained more viral particles than coarse aerosols, said Professor Paul Tambyah, an infectious diseases expert from the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine.

&gt; Prof Tambyah, a co-author of the paper, said while there was no linear relationship between the size of an aerosol particle and the amount of virus it carries, the size can give researchers a clue as to how much virus or parts of a virus are present in an aerosol particle.

&gt; Associate Professor Tham Kwok Wai, from the Department of the Built Environment at the NUS School of Design and Environment, said while previous studies had established the relative amount of aerosols produced through breathing, talking, and singing, none of them measured the amount of Sars-CoV-2 virus particles each activity can to generate.

&gt; ""Therefore, our team's work provides a foundation for estimating the risk of transmission of infection (for each activity),"" said Prof Tham, who was the leader of the study.

&gt; The paper was first published online in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases on Aug 6.

&gt; The team had studied 22 Covid-19 patients who were admitted to the NCID from February to April. Each of them was asked to perform, on the same day, three separate activities that involved exhaling air, which produced respiratory particles.

&gt; The activities were 30 minutes of breathing, 15 minutes of talking in the form of reading aloud passages from a children's book, and 15 minutes of singing different songs.

&gt; They rested between the activities.

&gt; While the participants were carrying out these activities, a specially designed equipment known as the Gesundheit-II was used to collect the respiratory particles that were generated.

&gt; The participants were required to place their head at the cone-shaped inlet of the equipment. The cone served as a ventilation hood where air was continuously drawn around the participant's head, allowing the collection of particles exhaled into the connecting sampler.

&gt; Aerosols were collected in two sizes - coarse and fine. The sample viral load was then quantified using a method known as reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

&gt; Project co-leader Kristen Coleman, from the Duke-NUS Medical School, said: ""We observed that Covid-19 patients who are early in the course of illness are likely to shed detectable levels of Sars-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory aerosols.""

&gt; However, the amount of virus expelled from talking and singing varied among patients, she noted.

&gt; ""Some released more virus from talking, as they may have spoken loudly during the experiments, though the underlying reason for why their viral loads were higher compared to singing, still remains unclear,"" Dr Coleman added.

&gt; Studying super spreaders

&gt; Prof Tambyah noted that swab samples from two of the 22 patients had such high viral loads that their samples accounted for half the total amount of virus collected in the study.

&gt; This was despite the fact that all the participants had low CT (cycle threshold) values, which would presumably signal high viral loads in their diagnostic swab tests.

&gt; The CT value refers to the number of cycles it takes for the RT-PCR test to detect the virus.

&gt; A patient with high viral load suggests that they are still incubating the virus and are infectious.

&gt; ""This reflects the phenomenon of (virus) dispersal or super spreaders and hopefully the next phase of the study will help us better understand this phenomenon,"" he said.

&gt; Prof Tambyah added that the amount of virus collected in the aerosol particles in the recent study was too low and attempts to culture the virus proved unsuccessful.

&gt; Reduce exposure

&gt; The authors said to reduce one's exposure to fine-particle aerosols in indoor environments, the existing safe management measures are important, along with increased room ventilation and more efficient air-cleaning technologies.

&gt; ""In situations involving singing, safe distancing among singers, as well as the averting and filtering of airflow from choir to audience, such as by deploying air curtains, are important considerations.

&gt; ""For situations involving talking, determining airflow patterns and minimising exposure through seating and furniture configurations, distancing, and air movement alteration, such as fans, including desk fans, are practical options that can be taken to lower the risk of Sars-CoV-2 transmission,"" said Prof Tham.

&gt; The researchers are now looking to establish the infectiousness of airborne aerosols, or live virus, that is emitted through talking by infected people.

&gt; They are also planning to use the same methods to determine if the aerosol viral load associated with the new variants - especially the Delta variant - is higher than previous strains.

Generally, RNA (or to be more specific, the CT values in a PCR test) correlate well with live virus shedding. Unclear why it wasn't the case here. Its possible that the aerosols contained fragments of disintegrated virus or viral RNA pieces released from infected airway tissue. 

Either way, I'd be very cautious about extending findings from an academic study which only found RNA shed, and not live virus being shed into any sort of public policy.

Isn't the utmost objective, to protect everyone from the virus? With this differentiation, does it mean it is more acceptable for the vaccinated to transmit the virus than for the unvaccinated to? It just looks like the unvaccinated are being made scapegoats. 

As selfish as it seems for the unvaccinated to want to practise basic rights such as eating out, it seems just as selfish for the vaccinated to do so with haught and the attitude that ""I get vaccinated just so I can do this and that"", especially when the vaccine is not a cure-all. 

The people choosing not to get vaccinated are not anti-vaccination; they are *for* safe vaccinations. One death is still one death too many, more so when it seems so coincidental (dying after getting the vaccination), and there are no answers from the government in whom we are supposed to trust. Is it okay to sacrifice some lives to save a few more? Are some lives more important than others? The same way the vaccinated are worried about dying by the virus, the unvaccinated are worried about dying by the vaccine. Both are valid concerns, and neither is more salient than the other. So why the need for discrimination and animosity?

The unvaccinated-by-choice are clearly aware of the risks of dying by Covid, and they are not afraid.

&gt; SINGAPORE - Individuals who received Covid-19 vaccinations overseas can visit designated clinics to verify their records for use in Singapore.

&gt; Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said in a Facebook post on Wednesday (Aug 11) that they can go to a clinic listed by the Health Ministry at this website to kick start the verification process.

&gt; They will have to show their overseas vaccination record and undergo a serology test to detect the presence of Covid-19 antibodies, said Mr Ong.

&gt; The record will be uploaded into the individual's HealthHub and the TraceTogether app if the serology test indicates that there are antibodies present.

&gt; Mr Ong said those who had the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty or Moderna vaccine will get the record updated about two days after their medical provider has submitted the details into the National Immunisation Registry.

&gt; But those who were given other vaccines on the World Health Organisation's emergency use listing, such as the Sinovac or AstraZeneca vaccine, will have their vaccination records reflected only on the HealthHub app for the time being. HealthHub is a portal that allows users to access their public health records and medical appointments online.

&gt; Mr Ong said that the authorities are working to upload these records to the TraceTogether app, which facilitates contact tracing, by the end of the month.

&gt; Mr Ong said he was responding to some ""top-of-mind questions"" after Covid-19 restrictions were eased to allow dining in from Tuesday.

&gt; On a question about how individuals who are unable to be vaccinated can join their family for meals, Mr Ong said they can take a pre-event test at an approved provider. Each test costs about $20 and is valid for 24 hours.

&gt; ""But that merely shows you are not likely to have the virus,"" Mr Ong added.

&gt; ""It does not protect you from being infected. So please be careful.""

&gt; He also said that children under 12 who cannot be vaccinated yet can dine out. But they must be seated with people from the same household, and the group size must not exceed five people.

&gt; On what happens if someone uses a vaccination certificate from another person, Mr Ong said the authorities are aware that ""such illegal practices are going on"".

&gt; ""The authorities will enforce against this, and offenders will face severe penalty,"" he said.

&gt; ""It is not worth it. Take a pre-event test if you have to attend a dinner or event.""

&gt; People who had allergic reactions after the first dose of an mRNA vaccine will be invited to have the Sinovac inactivated virus vaccine, Mr Ong said.

&gt; They can also go to any vaccination centre to verify that they cannot receive a second dose because of the allergy, said Mr Ong. They will then receive an SMS invitation.

&gt; The current 200,000 doses of the Government's stock of Sinovac's vaccine have already been allocated, and new stocks are expected to arrive in the next four to six weeks.

&gt; Individuals who do not want any of the Sinovac or mRNA vaccines can wait for the Novavax protein-based Covid-19 vaccine. Supplies are expected to start arriving before the end of the year, said Mr Ong.

&gt; SINGAPORE - Three new Covid-19 clusters were reported on Thursday (Aug 12), including clusters at Safra Tampines and My First Skool at 54 Chin Swee Road.

&gt; The Safra Tampines cluster has six new cases, bringing its total to nine.

&gt; Five new cases linked to the My First Skool cluster were reported Thursday, for a total of six cases.

&gt; The remaining new cluster that is linked to a confirmed Covid-19 case has three cases.

&gt; In its nightly update, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said there are now 119 active clusters, ranging between three and 1,151 infections.

&gt; Singapore recorded 59 new locally transmitted coronavirus cases on Thursday, including 19 unlinked cases. There were no imported cases.

&gt; The new cases bring Singapore's total to 66,012.

&gt; The number of new cases in the community has decreased from 723 cases in the week before to 412 cases in the past week, while the number of unlinked cases dropped from 215 to 117 cases over the same period.

&gt; Currently, 470 patients are warded in hospital. There are 36 people who require oxygen supplementation, and nine are in critical condition in the intensive care unit (ICU).

&gt; Five of these 45 cases are fully vaccinated.

&gt; Of those who have fallen very ill, 37 are seniors aged above 60, of whom 32 are completely unvaccinated or partially vaccinated.

&gt; ""There is continuing evidence that almost all fully vaccinated individuals do not suffer serious disease when infected, unless they had underlying medical conditions that made them more susceptible,"" said MOH.

&gt; It added that over the last 28 days, 9.3 per cent of those who are unvaccinated became severely ill or died, while the proportion of those fully vaccinated in this category is 0.9 per cent.

&gt; As at Wednesday, a total of 8,241,298 doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered under the national vaccination programme, covering 4,393,708 individuals, with 3,974,953 people having completed the full vaccination regimen.

&gt; In addition, 141,405 doses of other vaccines recognised in the World Health Organisation's Emergency Use Listing have been administered, covering 82,881 individuals.

&gt; In total, 73 per cent of Singapore residents have received two doses of the vaccines, and 81 per cent have received at least one dose.

343,"This. 

The eventual idea is that when we reconcile with it being endemic, it’s endemic. That’s not to say everyone starts making out with strangers in bars, but the expectation will have to be that it will slowly (due to vax rate) make it’s way through the population, with only modest cleanliness / prevention guidelines and only modest impact to the healthcare infrastructure. 

At that point, if there are countries with even moderate levels of covid, it shouldn’t be a major issue to travel, with only requirement being testing pre departure and post arrival. 

We’re probably a ways away from there, so September will likely be modest opening of travel, but there is light at the end of the tunnel.

&gt; SINGAPORE — The embassy of Israel in Singapore on Thursday (12 August) “strongly"" condemned recent social media posts comparing the city-state’s vaccination campaign and other related issues to the Holocaust.

&gt; In a post on its Facebook page, the embassy said, “The Holocaust was a genocide perpetrated by the Nazi regime to slaughter 6 million innocent Jews and comparing the obvious health benefits of vaccinations that have benefited billions around the world is not only in bad taste, but is also Holocaust Distortion by downplaying the horrors of the Holocaust.”

&gt; While the embassy did not specify details of the posts that it objected to, its message comes a day after Progress Singapore Party (PSP) member Brad Bowyer resigned from the opposition party after he drew flak for comparing Singapore’s COVID-19 safe management measures to the Holocaust.

&gt; PSP received Bowyer's resignation letter on Wednesday and accepted it, Kumaran Pillai, Head of Communications for the party, told Yahoo News Singapore.

&gt; On Tuesday, Bowyer posted a photo of a railway track leading to the main entrance of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp on his Facebook page. He juxtaposed the photo with text stating, ""It didn't start with gas chambers. It started with one party controlling the media...One party censoring speech and silencing opposition.""

&gt; In a separate post to announce his resignation on Wednesday, Bowyer said he chose the picture ""from the Holocaust"" as his family and other Singaporeans who have ""concerns about vaccination were formally made second class citizens in their own country”.

&gt; Taiwanese airline STARLUX Airlines have recently announced the launching of their new flight route connecting Singapore and Taipei that will commence on September 23.

&gt; In their press release, STARLUX said they will operate 2 weekly flights on Tuesdays and Thursdays, before increasing to 3 weekly flights with an additional flight on Saturday from October onwards.

&gt; According to their Facebook post, there will be Flatbed Business Class seats with about 82 inches of legroom and a 15.6-inch entertainment screen, and Economy Class seats with 31 inches of legroom and a 10.1-inch screen.

&gt; Passengers who book the route will also be flying in an Airbus A321neo, with cabin interior designed by BMW Group Designworks.

&gt; A quick search on their website shows that tickets for an Economy-class round-trip will cost around S$530, whilst Business-class seats will set you back around S$2,400.

&gt; However, it is important to note that the Taiwanese government has yet to open their borders to foreign tourists.

&gt; MOH: relaxed measures for travellers from Taiwan

&gt; The news comes after Singapore recently announced relaxed measures for travellers entering from Taiwan.

&gt; In Ministry of Health's (MOH) statement, all travellers that have spent 21 days in Taiwan prior to entering Singapore will not be required to serve 14 days of Stay Home Notice (SHN), as long as they test negative for the Covid-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test upon arrival.

&gt; Short-term visitors with travel history to Taiwan within the last 21 days can also apply for an Air Travel Pass to enter Singapore.

&gt; They will also be required to undergo a PCR test upon arrival and will not be required to serve 14 days of SHN as long as they test negative for Covid-19.

&gt; Taiwan yet to reopen to tourists

&gt; Taiwan recently reduced the epidemic alert to level 2, allowing dine-in at restaurants. With daily Covid-19 infection cases lower than 20 for the past week, the government has yet to announce plans to ease border control measures.

&gt; Taiwan Centers for Disease Control said in a statement that border restrictions remain in place, and foreigners are still not allowed to enter Taiwan as of now.

**Risks of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca**

Common side effects of vaccination include fatigue, headache, body aches and fever. More severe side effects of anaphylaxis and a condition called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) have been reported after COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca.  
TTS involves blood clotting with low platelet count. Current data indicates that TTS occurs in around 2 out of every 100,000 people who receive the first dose of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca. TTS appears to be far more rare following second doses, with data from the United Kingdom indicating a rate of 1.5 per million second doses.  
**The severity of illness due to TTS ranges from fatal cases and those with significant morbidity, to relatively milder cases.** TTS appears to be more severe in younger people. **In Australia, the overall case fatality rate is 3%.** Of the TTS cases that have been classified by the Therapeutic Goods Administration as confirmed or probable, over half have been discharged from hospital. **Around a quarter of the Australian cases so far have been more serious and have required treatment in intensive care, and tragically two people have died.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Discussing risks and benefits with consumers**  
**It is important that consumers weigh up the potential benefits and risk of harm from COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca to ensure that they make a fully informed decision about receiving the vaccine.** Consumers should be aware of the broader benefits of being vaccinated, as well as the benefits in preventing severe disease. Consumers should be made aware of the symptoms and signs of TTS, in the very rare event that it occurs.",7/12/2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/oignel/people_trying_to_gaslight_your_experience/h4wqsz0/

The covid mRNA vaccines went through human trials before WHO certification, i.e. they were tested on human volunteers, close to 9+ months ago iirc.

If you are asking about the long term safety, yes no one can peer into the future and guarantee you its safety, but every test we have subjected the vaccines to has been passed and no corner has been cut. You can compare covid to polio vaccine development in 1950s (similar situation closest to us in history)- covid vaccine development is a *lot* safer.

&gt;Measles vaccines have been proven safe and effective

Yes, but not quite to the level you expect. Measles vaccine as you and I took when young [has possible side effects](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11144371/), some lethal. The odds are really low, but they are there.

The point is really you can disagree and have an opinion on vaccination efforts, but it's difficult to argue against the *need* for vaccination *now*, even if side effects are present.

Singaporeans are angry because the government favours the corporate letting singaporeans fight with global talentfor jobs in Singapore. Leaving singaporeans to work in less favourable conditions. 

I worked in tech, faang, and a fortune 500 companies and I can tell you Singaporean are a MINORITY and it is a problem. We bring in so many great companies  only to hire expats? And all the coordination, contract roles and maternity covers and support roles like legal and hr are done by Singaporeans and this is A FACT.  Why are Singaporeans contractors? Because the expats cannot risk their employment pass especially when they have uprooted their families, also Singaporeans are desperate to work for the big guys. 

As a Singaporean you should stand up for your fellow Singaporeans on this fight to clamp down this unfavourable  playing field. There's  no country in this world that favours foreigners more than their citizens except Singapore. 

When I work in tech, only after a few of us lodge a formal complaint about hiring foreigners before hr flagged this out and tried to hire more Singaporeans.  Damage was done, because we missed up hiring 20 great singaporeans but it went to 20 other SINGLE nationalities  with no working experience do you know how detrimental this is? These 20 foreigners will move to other companies in Singapore and do a tech circle around the FAANG companies for years and years. Making them the best in the field.  This is opportunity cost for Singaporeans! If we had a law to protect Singaporean then we will have at least 15 more singaporeans doing us proud in the tech field. But did that happens? No. 

It was a fresh grad role being paid 8k. Which singaporean dont want? They didnt hire a single singaporean and I put all my best ever Singaporean friends up for a fight. They didnt even get a call. Not because they suck, not because they didnt want the job. There was just no incentive to even bother maybe hiring a Singaporean. 

It'll  never  happen in Australia  or the US or any other first to third world country because their citizens are at least the first to be screens hence theres a level ot protection by not us.

I made another observation. So I moved out of tech and now I'm going back and I'm starting to get calls now because, covid and these faang companies cant hire unless you're Singaporean or already living in singapore. I would have NEVER even gotten in or gotten a call. But theres a chance for me now. But why only now? 

Talk is cheap about letting a foreigner in and singaporeans are cry babies but the tech world and other industries are small and one step in, is a career for a lifetime. So it is important and while I cannot change my career I'm already mid management and my industry is starting to solidify.  I 'made it' but of my entire school  cohort, of 350 kids.

Just imagine a hospital with full open air concept, broken windows everywhere, nurses that don't give a shit and no. of ICU wards that I can count with my fingers :"") Entering the place feels as if I travelled back in time looking at how the daily logs and updates are still done in freaking pen and paper LOL",7/12/2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/oidk84/rsingapore_random_discussion_and_small_questions/h4wcstu/
404,"&gt; # Singapore-Australia travel bubble more likely in end-2021, says Australian minister

&gt; SINGAPORE: A planned travel bubble between Singapore and Australia is ""more likely to happen"" towards the end of 2021, said Australian Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment Dan Tehan.

&gt; Speaking to CNA, Mr Tehan said that certain measures have to be implemented before a travel bubble can be launched between the two countries.

&gt; ""Obviously we want to see a travel bubble with Singapore and that’s something that both countries are aiming for,"" he said.

&gt; 

&gt; “At this stage, it’s more likely to happen towards the end of this year as we make sure that both countries can fully roll out their vaccination programmes.""

&gt; Other measures such as vaccine certificates will also need to be in place, Mr Tehan said.

&gt; 

&gt; Officials from the two countries will “continue to engage” on the matter, he added.

&gt;

&gt; Plans for a potential bubble have been on hold due to a third wave of COVID-19 in Australia, Mr Tehan told Melbourne-based newspaper The Age on Sunday.

&gt; 

&gt; The country reported on Monday another record daily rise for the year with 112 new cases, fuelled by the highly infectious Delta variant.

&gt; Almost all the cases were in Sydney, despite the city entering its third week of lockdown. A woman in her 90s also became the country's first COVID-19 fatality this year.

&gt; Mr Tehan is making an official visit to Singapore as part of a tour of various countries - including Vietnam, South Korea, Japan and the United States - to strengthen Australia’s trading relationships.

&gt; 

&gt; He met Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the Istana on Monday, and is also scheduled to meet Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong.

&gt; 

&gt; About 40 per cent of Singapore’s population have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. For Australia, about 11 per cent of its adult population, or 20.5 million, have received both shots of a vaccine.

&gt; 

&gt; Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in March that the two countries were in talks on a possible air travel bubble.

&gt; 

&gt; Australian media reported at the time that the bubble - which could also have included New Zealand as part of a three-way arrangement - was expected to kick off by July or August this year.

&gt; 

&gt; In June, Prime Minister Lee and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the countries were working on resuming air travel in a “safe and calibrated manner”.

&gt; 

&gt; Students from Singapore could be given priority to travel to Australia to pursue or complete their studies when the infrastructure for safe travel is in place, they said then.

&gt; 

&gt; Later that month, however, a Singapore Airlines senior executive told the Sydney Morning Herald that the national carrier was no longer working towards a timeline for the travel bubble, citing concerns about its implementation.

407,"You pretty much described it perfectly. The virus is known to spread asymptomatically, and if you're fully vaccinated, there's a 96% chance you won't have symptoms even if you get infected. We know from UK studies that a vaccinated person is still slightly infectious, but 50-80% less than an unvaccinated person. 

There are almost certainly some fully vaccinated and asymptomatic carriers in the population. These people are at zero risk to the disease and won't go to the doctor because they don't even know that they are infected. Since a large proportion of our population is already vaccinated (at least partially), the people exposed to the virus by the carrier are largely protected from the virus entering their body. Even if they become infected themselves, they probably won't even feel symptoms and will not be affected by the virus at all. This can carry on until the chain dies out naturally or one person eventually develops symptoms and gets swabbed. In an endemic disease like COVID, this should be expected and normalized.

All in all, there's absolutely nothing to be concerned about fluctuations like this. Nearly all of the infected cases will be asymptomatic or mild, and our hospitals have more than enough beds and oxygen to care for the few, likely unvaccinated, serious cases. Even in the UK where the Delta variant is let loose, active hospitalizations and deaths have barely moved from last month. Our vaccination programme is still progressing rapidly and with every jab delivered, our country gets even safer.",7/12/2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/oimn1u/8_new_cases_of_locally_transmitted_covid19/h4weyu9/
408,"If we go by layman logic, yes, it should logically be the case that the breaching MC charge cannot bite if its established that the MC was procured by falsehood.

But I think there's an argument to be made that [Reg 3(2)](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/IDA1976-S182-2020#pr3-) of the Covid Stay Orders Regulation is a strict liability offense and the regulation's definition of ""relevant medical certificate"" is silent for such a scenario - it obviously wasn't drafted with such jokers in mind. So the underlying defect in the MC doesn't invalidate the elements of the Reg 3(2) charge.

Rather than the prosecution playing hardball on 2 logically inconsistent charges, my guess is that the charges were actually recommended because they genuinely believe they have good prospects to prevail on both.

Will be quite interesting to see what course of action Mr Lim takes.",7/12/2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/oils91/man_charged_with_cheating_doctor_into_issuing_an/h4wfav1/
409,"I am interested to see your evidence of this.  The documented reports I have seen show that the myocarditis is transient and resolves quickly, and is significantly less of an issue than the known cardiac complications of COVID19 infection.  

The delta variant appears to have a R rate of 8, so is highly infectious; if you are not vaccinated, the chances of catching it are extremely high.  The vaccine appears to prevent all serious complications (including the documented long-COVID syndrome).  Interestingly, nearly 100% of the deaths in the US are coming from people who have not been vaccinated...

They did put in their FAQ. But there's not enough people reporting it so they are taking it as a low risk item.
